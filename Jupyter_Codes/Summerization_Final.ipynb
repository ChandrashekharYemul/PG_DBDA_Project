            "Lima, Nov 19, 2016 (AFP) -Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Asia-Pacific leaders Saturday to get on board with Beijing-backed free trade agreements, after Donald TrumpÂ´s election win spelled the likely demise of a US-backed deal.TrumpÂ´s shock victory has cast uncertainty on the future of WashingtonÂ´s key trade initiative in the Pacific Rim, the arduously negotiated, 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.The brash billionaire campaigned against the accord, which has not yet been ratified in Congress, as a \"terrible deal\" that would \"rape\" the United States by sending American jobs to countries with cheaper labor.In a Pacific region hungry for trade, that has left even longtime US allies like Australia and Japan looking to China to fill the void.Beijing, which was excluded from TPP, is pushing two alternatives: the 21-member Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and a 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which notably includes India but not the United States.Xi urged regional leaders to advance both deals at a summit in Lima, Peru, where the uncertainty unleashed on the world stage by TrumpÂ´s victory loomed large.\n",
            "\"Building a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for the long-term prosperity of the Asia-Pacific,\" Xi said in a keynote address to business leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group.\n",
            "\"We should firmly pursue FTAAP,\" he said.\n"
