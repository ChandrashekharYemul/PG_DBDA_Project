Australia have dominated the sport at the quadrennial event winning seven golds in men and four in women. India meanwhile clinched three silver medals in the men\'s event and three including a gold in 2002 in the women\'s.""Absence of hockey at the Commonwealth Games is not a good sign.

Glasgow Games organisers had proposed four venues -- Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome Scotstoun Stadium (rugby and squash facilities) Tollcross International Swimming Centre and Scottish Events Campus.

Our policies are such that if you win medals at the Commonwealth Games then you get jobs and prize money. But now that this decision is made we can only guess why hockey has been omitted"" said Rupinder.Later the Federation of International Hockey (FIH) clarified that the decision to not include the sport in Glasgow was a one-off.“Whilst the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) had to confirm a new host for the 2026 Games in a short timeframe after the withdrawal from the Victorian Government and whilst we’ve taken note that the new concept for 2026 has been downsized with a core offering of only 10 sports we’re all the more disappointed by the CGF’s decision not to have hockey on the 2026 Glasgow Commonwealth Games programme” the FIH said in a statement.“That our sport has been played at every Commonwealth Games since 1998 something we are very proud of. With a reduction from 19 to 10 sports compared to the last edition of the Games hockey is therefore in the same situation as eight other sports” the statement continued.“However the CGF has been very clear in their various exchanges with FIH that this decision is exceptional and related to the challenging nature of this specific edition of the Commonwealth Games.“CGF has asserted that this decision will not impact the inclusion of hockey into future editions of the Commonwealth Games and that FIH remains a key partner and friend in both the history and future of the Commonwealth movement” a FIH spokesperson said in a statement.“As CGF has confirmed that hockey remains an important sport for the Federation its members and the Commonwealth movement we welcome their invitation to discuss further opportunities for hockey with the Commonwealth movement in the future” the statement said.']",,,,

Even if it requires them to give an extra leeway to the owners in the first three years of HIL it won't be a bad bargain to sustain the league and cash in on it in the subsequent years. Eight teams will be in the fray in the men's edition and four teams in the women's edition."""," ""Photo Source: XNEW DELHI: The return of Hockey India League (HIL) is perhaps the news everyone connected to the sport globally was looking forward to. The promise made a year ago is ready to be delivered the added bonanza being the introduction of the women's edition that will run simultaneously along with the men's tournament.The leagues begin in just over 60 days from now on December 28; and the major part onboarding players through an auction has been done after a stumble which was the kind of fear that kept the HIL on the backburner for seven years.TEETHING ISSUESConvincing corporates to invest in the league was only possible after two consecutive Olympic bronze medals. Still one (Ranchi - Navoyam Sports Ventures Pvt Ltd) of them chickened out as the men's team owner at the last moment. But Hockey India (HI) did well to have a back-up in Tarini Prasad Mohanty a mining magnate from Odisha who invested in the name of his native village and Team Gonasika (registered with its base as Visakhapatnam) replaced Navoyam in the auction hall to keep the total number of men's teams at eight.  BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKELearn about hotel management diplomahotel management diploma | Search AdsLearn MoreThe women's league was initially announced as a six-team event but a last-minute development saw HI announcing that the remaining two franchises -- Hyderabad and Mumbai -- will join only from Season 2 onwards which will keep the maiden Women's HIL a four-team affair.That's the kind of pre-emptive actions HI will have to keep ready in the first three years of HIL's return which are expected to have a few bumps on the way.BROADCAST PARTNERWhere HI missed out initially is onboarding a broadcaster ahead of the players' auction which is a kind of clincher in the success of a franchise-based league that is trying to re-establish itself. It was one of the reasons for the less-than-expected digital outreach and buzz around the announcement of the league and the subsequent auction despite a YouTube livestream.It is understood that Reliance-owned Jio is virtually in. If that holds true even if the contract turns out to be for the first season only initially a broadcaster like Jio can fetch HIL the eyeballs which is pivotal because the league won't travel across the country this year.The men's edition will be played at the Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium in Rourkela and the women's league will be held at the Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Astroturf Hockey Stadium in Ranchi.It's a decision that will spare HI the franchises and the broadcasters the logistical costs in HIL's re-establishing year. But it also brings along a few challenges.GRABBING ATTENTIONIt will be a challenge for the new government in Odisha to match the kind of buzz and fanfare that the former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and his team used to generate around major hockey events in the state. Despite that it will remain a task to keep the interest of the locals and fill up the 20000-capacity stadium for 36 days in a row.The women's league in Ranchi will face a similar challenge even though the stadium's capacity there is only 5000.It's also difficult to see national media organisations who don't have local bureaus around Rourkela and Ranchi to station reporters for a month-long duration despite the presence of Indian and international stars. The league's first two weeks coinciding with the Indian cricket team's Test tour of Australia will also present a challenge in getting traction digitally in the news and on live broadcast.The start of a tournament is always important to get engagement and build interest; and with challenges abound HIL's digital planning holds the key and will have to stand out.The men's HIL will run from December 28 to February 1 while the women's edition which is scheduled to begin on the same date as men's will undergo a change in its duration after the number of teams in Season 1 reduced from six to four.Another major announcement is still awaited.The Hero Group was the HIL's title sponsor from 2013 to 2015 while it was known as the Coal India HIL in 2016 and 2017 before HI hit the pause button on the league. A title-sponsor is another major check-box in sustenance of a franchise-based league. While it's likely that Hero will revive its relationship with the HIL the official announcement on the name is still awaited.SUSTAIN ALL-ROUND INTERESTThe episode with the withdrawal of Ranchi franchise is what presents the biggest scare to HIL in its bid to sustain itself. Corporate money is what any franchise-based league in the world flourishes on. If corporate pulls the plug like Navoyam did it can lead to a ripple effect -- especially at a time when the HIL is trying to find its footing again.Companies like the Charles Group (Chennai) Vedanta Limited (Odisha) and Resolute Sports (Hyderabad) and investor Tarini Prasad Mohanty (Team Gonasika) are new to the business of owning sports teams and will take time to build conviction that their investment will eventually work out.While the actual terms of the contract are not known HI will have to allow franchises the freedom to earn through means like advertisement revenue player engagement branding digital campaigns and so on in order to get on the path of achieving a break-even within the first three seasons of the league.Corporate thinking revolves around return of investment and HI will have to understand that. Even if it requires them to give an extra leeway to the owners in the first three years of HIL it won't be a bad bargain to sustain the league and cash in on it in the subsequent years.The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has already given a clear 35-day window to the HIL for the next 10 years which means the international calendar can be planned accordingly and the availability of top players in HIL is sorted.But the sustenance of HIL will largely depend on navigating through the occasional storms in the first three years and HI should plan all its moves with that in mind with a Plan B in place.ALSO WATCHIND vs NZ: Decoding what went wrong for Rohit Sharma & Co. | Injury Updates: Pant Gill & Shami""]",,,,

Those two adjectives used by Germany coach Andre Henning on Sunday to describe India hold a lot of context. That\'s how the world looks at India when it comes to hockey. But what\'s left for \'the number one country for hockey\' at the end of this Men\'s World Cup is questions and hours of introspection while the Germans sing along merrily on their way back home with the World Cup trophy in their hands.It was a final to remember between Germany and Belgium.It could well be described as a boxing match as the two teams never stopped throwing punches. Everytime the crowd felt one team was down for the count like Germany looked like when trailing 0-2 it rose up to throw a jab.For the third pressure game in a row starting with the quarterfinals Germany erased a two-goal deficit to become champions for the third time. First it was England then Australia and finally Belgium. That\'s how World Cups are won. Cliched it may sound but you have to beat the best to be the best.TOI PhotoThe Germans are not just the new world champions but also the new world No. 1 team in men\'s hockey.""I have known some of these guys from the time they were 13 or 14 and seen their journey for Germany for the past 10 years"" said coach Henning after the final. ""They\'ve lost some big games but finally they made it. The group fell sometimes but they are here again. So happy to see them celebrate in India and the capital of hockey.""The Belgians though haven\'t lost any fans. To be in a second consecutive World Cup final after their maiden entry in the summit clash in 2018 speaks volumes of how much they have improved. And to win a World Cup an Olympic gold and another World Cup silver in the space of five years is not earned without breaking a sweat.What the Red Lions have done in the last 15 years to storm back from the bottom of world hockey to the top is study material for many teams to follow and learn from.The Germans knew how tough teams like Belgium would make it for them in Odisha. So they trained differently to achieve a goal that they had been trying to achieve for 17 years since their last World Cup triumph at home in 2006.""In the summer we had a camp without any hockey. We met in Sweden on a hidden island without any hockey sticks or phones. After that trip the guys swore to each other that we are training like never before"" said Henning.""Germany is one of the last countries that does not have centralised training and we don\'t see everyone together often. We have the league and a few camps. I don\'t see the boys for three months. They train individually. So they have to be self-motivated a lot because you don\'t have your head coach or coach around.""But every team has its own style of training. India for that matter trains completely the opposite way to what Henning described. The team is in national camps for around 150 days a year and then travelling or playing at home for another 100-odd days a year. That\'s pretty intensive.Perhaps there is a need for Hockey India to relook at the training module not in terms of how they train but how much they train. In other words put a little bit more focus on allowing players time to be in their personal space and around their families and loved ones a lot more than they do currently. Does it make them more focused and less stressed mentally? That sort of introspection is required more than swapping personnels in a knee-jerk reaction with the Asian Games just six months away.TOI PhotoThat however shouldn\'t stop Hockey India from asking some tough questions of coach Graham Reid and some of the senior players which the president Dilip Tirkey has promised he will.South Korea were the only Asian team to enter the quarterfinals which not only puts focus on their re-emergence in the continent but how much tougher it\'s going to be to win the Asian Games gold and qualify for the Paris Olympics.Time to ponder for Team India.']",,,,

His drag-flicks were sorted out by the Belgian rushers.It was the 10th minute when the Belgian ascendancy resulted in a goal.(AFP Photo)Tom Boon got a loose ball and went for a tomahawk but the ball took a deflection from a German stick to go out for a long corner. Belgium didn't waste time to restart and Florent van Aubel managed to control a bouncing ball from Antoine Kina which he slammed into the German post on the bounce.A minute later Kina once again came up with an assist that turned into a goal. Cosyns placed himself beautifully at the end of Kina's cross from inside the circle to cutely deflect the ball in behind goalkeeper Alexander Stadler to increase Belgium's lead to 2-0.Vanasch continued to keep the Germans at bay coming up with brilliant saves including a penalty stroke in the 19th minute.A push challenge from behind on Moritz Trompertz by Arthur van Doren inside the circle resulted in the referee awarding a penalty stroke. But Vanasch didn't let Tom Grambusch's attempt go past him. Four minutes after that Marco Miltkau tried a cheeky deflection off a slap from the edge of the 23-yard line but it sailed harmlessly over Vanasch and the crossbar.Looking desperately for a goal before half-time it was Niklas Wellen who became a father during the tournament provided that for Germany off a variation on a penalty corner. Controlling a ricochet that tapped twice on his stick Wellen smashed it into the goal to make it 2-1.Belgium were down to 10 men in when Nicolas de Kerpel was shown a green card in the 40th minute. The next minute the Germans took advantage and made it 2-2 with Peillat's shot finally finding a way through on a penalty corner to sound the board.And when Mats Grambusch pulled off a stunning goal out of nowhere from an acute angle in the 48th minute the chants of 'Belgium Belgium' from a small group of the Red Lions' supporters were hushed.The Germans were now leading 3-2 after being down 0-2.The defending champions had no choice left than to pull out all stops which is what they did to up the ante in the last five minutes.Back-to-back penalty corners for Belgium put the German defence under pressure. And just when the Germans had one hand on the trophy Boon deposited the ball into the net in the 59th minute to make it 3-3 which is what the score remained at the end of 60 minutes.The shootout extended to 14 attempts each from the customary five as the World Cup final required a sudden-death tie-breaker to find the winner.Belgian custodian Vanasch and Danneberg who replaced Stadler in the German post for the shootouts were now in focus and both did their job by saving two attempts each which ended the shootout at 3-3 as well.Man-of-the-Match Wellen and Thies Prinz converted for Germany in sudden-death but only van Aubel could score for the defending champions.

They have won the title in 1973 1990 and 1998.For three-time champions Australia this was the first time they are returning home without a medal after they finished fourth in the 1998 edition. They had won a bronze in the last edition here.Australia dominated the first quarter of the third-fourth place match between the losing semifinalists with more circle entries while the young Netherlands side relied on counter-attacks.Blake Govers had a go at the Dutch goal in the seventh minute but his shot went wide. Four minutes later captain Aran Zalewski also missed the target from a fine pass from a Hayward pass.The Kookaburras earned two penalty corners and took the lead from the second PC two minutes before the end of the first quarter with Hayward sounding the board for his ninth goal of the tournament.Netherlands considered the most attacking side in the tournament began to grow from the second quarter which did not yield any goal and Koen Bijen's opportunistic attempt went just wide in the 22nd minute.Australia led 1-0 at the breather but the Dutch turned up a completely different side in the second half as they pumped in three goals in the third quarter.Captain Brinkman was at his absolute best lording the midfield play supplying the forwards and even scoring goals himself.After Janssen struck from Netherlands' fourth PC of the match Brinkman scored two brilliant field goals in the 35th and 40th minutes to give his side a 3-1 lead.The young Netherlands side were quick on counterattacks and on many occasions the Australian defence was caught napping by the sheer speed of the Dutchmen.Brinkman's second goal -- and Netherlands' third -- though resulted from a defensive blunder from Australia's Tim Howard who failed to clear the ball from inside his own circle properly.Netherlands thought they had scored another goal seven minutes before the final hooter but the video umpire ruled otherwise.""]",,,,

The Indian players do not have a central contract which assures them of a fixed sum or an education programme.While there is a financial windfall when they win a medal in a major tournament the Olympics for example the rewards are few. Contrast this with players from European powerhouses like Belgium Netherlands or Germany. They are either semi-professionals or are professional players who ply their wares in European leagues.New Zealand goalkeeper Leon Hayward and his Australian counterpart Andrew Charter are ideal examples. One is a chartered account and the other a mechanical engineer. Many of the players in Chile and Wales are qualified professionals who take career breaks to participate in tournaments like the World Cup.However Indian players are guilty of failing to make use of the available facilities.

How has your experience as Hockey India president been so far?It's an honour to be the Hockey India president. I think the (erstwhile) IHF was formed in 1925. It's the first time that a former player has been elected president of the federation. At the same time it is challenging and tough. Many people have expectations (from me). So there is a lot of responsibility and I am preparing accordingly.Q. You have been in different administrative roles previously with the Odisha government. How different is this?I think I was born for hockey because when I started playing I didn't know it could be a way of life and a path that leads to the Olympics World Cups. After retiring I didn't know I could become an administrator as well. So whether it's to play or to govern I am made for hockey. That's what I believe. After coming into administration I have realized that as a players we were only bothered about giving performance winning losing. But now as a president I have learned that you are responsible for the development of the sport right from the district level at sub-junior junior and senior levels both men and women the national championships how to develop coaches and umpires from where to get the sponsors how to bring back Hockey India League (HIL). So as a president I am responsible for all that.Q. A World Cup in India with a former player as Hockey Indian president. Any memorable experience of meeting some old friends during the tournament?When I met Max Caldas chief coach of the Spain team it reminded us of a past moment that we shared with each other. We talked about the time when I went to play for the club Klein Zwitserland in the Dutch league. Caldas also used to play for the same club and I lived in the same apartment that he used to live in. By then he had quit playing. I found his old stick in the apartment and called Maxi if I could play with that stick. He said 'why not'. The other day he said that he was very honoured that I played with his stick (smiles).In one of the seasons of the PHL (Premier Hockey League) I think 2006-07 I used the same hockey stick. I was hitting very well with it scored many goals and became the tournament's top scorer that year. So we were having fun talking about that.PTI PhotoQ. You mentioned HIL and we know how big a role it has played as a feeder of quality players who went on to win the 2016 Junior World Cup and the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. But the HIL hasn't happened since 2017. What are the efforts Hockey India is making to revive the league?I also believe HIL has been a big platform for our young Indian players to gain experience get exposure. We could see how the youth players gained confidence. I agree with that and we are looking at how the league can come back and our young players get more chances. Talks are on.Q. Is Hockey Indian discussing possibilities with the same old HIL team owners or are there new investors willing to come forward?Call it investors or agencies we are trying to find (interested parties) who can be associated with the sport on a long-term basis and also contribute to the sport's development. We are getting positive responses as well. Things will be clearer in a month or two when I will be able to tell you more details.Q. The new FIH president Tayyab Ikram said a window for HIL with the availability of all international stars without disturbing the Pro League fixtures is being looked at...Yes we have had a word with him. We have requested that (window for HIL). Hockey India League is very important not just for Indian hockey but also for world hockey. He understands this and has given a positive response towards finding a window for HIL.Q. Talking about that state-level hockey in India is slowly vanishing. Many school- and club-level tournaments have vanished off the calendar especially if we look at Delhi. How will you fix that problem?You are right. We have the national championship at sub-junior junior and senior levels. But whatever domestic championships we have our top players are not available to play because of a packed international calendar. And until those stars are there in those events (the domestic tournaments will not become popular again). So I understand. We have to keep that in mind somewhere domestic hockey is getting overlooked.We have requested all the state bodies to work towards that with the state government and corporates. When we talk about domestic hockey the state units should be self-sufficient only then we will be able to develop. Wherever in India there is hockey (culture) the state body must ensure that local tournaments happen continuously. If it has happened in Odisha it's only because of the state government.Image credit: Hockey IndiaQ. You talk about unavailability of stars in tournaments like the national championship. As Hockey Indian president are you looking at giving more regular breaks to players so that it also helps them to be in a better space mentally in order to perform consistently?We have noticed that players have been spending a lot of time in national camps. We will work something out and talk to players whether camps lasting months is a problem or not.Q. Continuing with the topic of India's top players the team's performance at this World Cup has unfortunately been nothing short of a disaster. What are your views as a Hockey India president?First of all we will have a meeting after the tournament with the coach the team and other staff. We will talk to the senior players about what was it because of which the performance couldn't match the expectations. The biggest reason at this point I had the confidence that if our drag-flicker works the Indian team will perform well. But in the four matches (until the crossover defeat against New Zealand) our dragflicker Harmanpret (Singh) wasn't in form. Had he been in form the results would have been different. The team's confidence would have been different. That's the biggest reason according to me. There are other reasons as well which we will discuss with the team later.Q. As a former player what do you think the team lacked?If we talk about the league (pool) matches the hunger to win was somewhere lacking. When we know that goal difference is very important in the league stage we should have gone for it (converted our chances into goals); I couldn't see that. We played well against England but short corners didn't work and we missed field goals as well. So the hunger was missing somewhere. I understand that one of our main players (Hardik Singh) got injured but that doesn't mean the team gets bogged down. Then in the pre-quarterfinal (crossover) as well we were leading 3-1...I agree that tiebreakers (shootouts) can go either way but twice we got the chance where we could have won by scoring. All in all so many chances we missed. So that's what I mean by the hunger missing.PTI PhotoQ. Were you surprised to see four youngsters -- Rajkumar Pal Abhishek Sukhjeet Singh Shamsher Singh -- among the five men picked for the penalty shootout against New Zealand?Both the goalkeepers (PR Sreejesh and Krishan Pathak) did well. Excellent! It (shootout line-up) was not surprising for me because definitely we felt that our young players are there because they are good.Q. Are you also somewhere worried why none from the 2021 Junior World Cup could come into the senior squad for this World Cup. We had seven from the 2016 junior World Cup-winning team in the 2018 World Cup...There could be many reasons. The Junior World Cup is a feeder tournament for the senior World Cup. It happened after the 2001 Junior World Cup as well when many players went on to play for the senior team. That it couldn't happen this time (2021) surprises me as well. We have to pay attention to this fact.Q. Last question. The position of High Performance Director at Hockey India has been vacant for some time now. What's the latest on that?After the World Cup we will discuss it again.""]",,,

Due to the low number of positive cases over the years in hockey there may not be the need to test a lot of samples.Around 20 samples had been collected in the ongoing World Cup till the end of crossover matches which is very low for a global showpiece. Twenty-eight matches out of a total 44 had been played till the crossovers stage.Compared to this the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar saw more than 1600 dope samples being collected.The FIH however said that ""more samples may be collected"" in the remaining matches (16 matches). It also said that the participating players have already been tested earlier.The samples were collected by the officers of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).""All the teams were already tested. Players to be tested are drawn and this is conducted by NADO (National Anti-Doping Organisation)"" Maingot said.""The process is managed by ITA (International Testing Agency) but the Indian NADO is the one responsible for the sample collection.""In 2021 200 samples from 177 players were collected out of which 127 were in-competition and 73 out-of-competition. Urine samples numbered 183 while 17 were blood samples. Fifty-one per cent of the samples were of male players.The players from whom samples were collected in 2021 belonged to 32 countries.India was among 10 countries whose players were tested the most in 2021.In 2020 the FIH contractually delegated the management and implementation of parts of its anti-doping programme to Switzerland-based ITA.The FIH said that since 2016 the number of tests per year has been increasing in order to maintain its status as one of the cleanest sports in the world. Every athlete who competes in an FIH event must have completed an Anti-Doping online educational course within the previous two years and this was included in tournament regulations.""Since July 2015 the FIH has made it a requirement that all players must have completed an approved anti-doping education programme to be able to compete in FIH events. Any players who do not hold a valid Anti-Doping Certificate (valid for 2 years) will not be allowed to play in the competition until they have done so.""On-site anti-doping education booths were to be set up at events like the FIH Men\'s World Cup 2023 but it could not be implemented this time in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela.""Not for this event due to the complexity of the travels and time limitations. However all athletes had to pass through an anti-doping education course to participate in this event"" Maingot said.Despite the low number of positive and sanctioned cases there was a famous doping case in world hockey more than a decade ago and the Spanish women\'s team was on the verge of missing the 2008 Olympic Games after winning the qualifying event in Baku Azerbaijan.Two of their players had tested positive for party drug MDMA (methylenedioxy methamphetamine) also known as \'Ecstasy\' or \'Molly\'. Spain alleged sabotage in Baku. According to FIH rules at the time if more than one member tested positive the whole team could be disqualified.However the FIH disciplinary commission found that only one player was guilty of doping violation. Azerbaijan appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) but Spain won the case.In India Jarmanpreet Singh who is in the India team for the ongoing World Cup was handed a two-year suspension after failing a random dope test in 2015 when he was playing in the Hockey India League.Former India goalkeeper Akash Chikte was suspended for two years in 2018 but the ban period was reduced to 13 months later after the appeal panel of the National Anti-Doping Agency concluded that he did not take the prohibited substance intentionally.']",,,

And the Indian team responded in style to hammer the 2018 Asian Games champions Japan 8-0.It was a game of many firsts for the home team that was pushed out of the title race by New Zealand in the crossovers.As it happened: India vs JapanFive of India's eight goals came off penalty corners (PC) including skipper Harmanpreet Singh's drag-flick managing to beat a goalkeeper on a PC for the first time in the tournament. India's PC conversion rate was the best in five matches -- 5/11.Abhishek (36th and 44th minute) and Harmanpreet (46th and 59th) pumped in two goals each while Vivek Sagar Prasad (40th) Manpreet Singh (59th) and Sukhjeet Singh (60th) joined Mandeep to score one goal apiece.The team played like a giant woken up from its sleep pounding Japan with a flurry of counter-attacks for the majority of 60 minutes which had all: PCs variations on PCs fluid midfield and goals.But the first 30 minutes were goal-less.Mandeep Singh's off-the-ball running finally returned against the opposition he likes the most to score against. Mandeep's name was the first on the list of goal-scorers  with his neat deflection on a set-piece in the 33rd minute. It opened the floodgates.The pattern of the game didn't change thereafter -- India attacked Japan defended. It remained that way till the final whistle.Vivek Sagar Prasad whose selection straight into a World Cup after a long injury layoff has been questioned finally managed to add some fluidity to the midfield. He set up Abhishek nicely at the end of a counter-attack and Abhishek's reverse-hit deposited in the net for a 2-0 lead.Like Mandeep and Abhishek Vivek also scored his first goal of this World Cup when a rebound off Harmanpreet's drag-flick fell onto his stick and Vivek's crisp hit sounded the board.By now the Indian team was having fun and almost had a hitting session in front of the Japanese post. In between with the game being as open as a hockey match can be Japan had their chances; but the Indian goalkeepers PR Sreejesh and Krishan Pathak managed to keep them at bay for a clean sheet.Abhishek's reverse hit in the net then made it 4-0 while Harmanpreet heaved a sigh of relief when finally a drag-flick from his stick beat a goalkeeper. His first and previous PC goal came in the pool stage when the Welsh team had withdrawn their goalkeeper.Japan then replaced their goalkeeper Takashi Yoshikawa who stood like a wall for 30 minutes before wilting under pressure in the third quarter with Kisho Kuroda.The dying minutes of the game were played inside Japan's 23-yard with India scoring thrice inside two minutes.A field goal by Manpreet Singh Harmanpreet's second goal off a PC and Sukhjeet making full use of another rebound off Kuroda's pads on a PC to find the goal rounded off Japan's misery.India will now take on South Africa on Saturday in the 9th-12th place playoff.""]",,,,

It’s honestly been on my bucket list of places I wanted to come and to have a purpose. This has always been a country I’ve wanted to come to and to travel in and I’m so grateful that finally there’s an opportunity to be here. To be here I think makes life extra meaningful. I would love to try Indian chaat visit India Gate explore the local markets and if time provided travel to Taj Mahal.Our own double Olympic medallist javelin champion Neeraj Chopra recently welcomed you to India on Instagram...Neeraj is very kind and shy which you would not expect for him to be obviously being such a huge hero and superstar here. But I think it’s stars like him that people respect the most. They are confident and certain enough in themselves that they don’t have to be so boisterous. Neeraj’s achievements as an Olympic champion have inspired me a lot. When he competes it’s way more than about himself. You can really feel the pride of his country what he does and his devotion and craftsmanship. What he has done for India it’s inspiring for athletes world over.I feel my accomplishment of being the first American to win two gold medals as a field athlete is nothing compared to his first gold in athletics for an entire nation. He is incredibly inspiring one of the most fantastic ambassadors for athletics. We first met and chatted at the 2022 Diamond League Finals in Brussels where we both won the title trophy. I put out an Instagram story of coming here and right away he messaged me saying ‘Welcome to India’.How does it feel like being a two-time Olympic champion and the first American woman to be double medallist in the world championships?It took me a long time before I thought discus would be a career. It’s such a niche thing there’s only five to eight women in the entire world that can truly make it a career. And for a long time it was just something that I enjoyed doing. It’s still hard to believe that I am a twotime Olympic champion. I feel really proud about it. When I think back I will feel so proud of the medals. Those moments are the ones I will cherish for life.You started as a dancer – ballet hip-hop and contemporary dance – taking up track and field in high school and you are two-time Olympic champion today...My journey can definitely be summarised as unfolding in ways I never imagined possible. I started with dance and that really became my passion when I was a teenager. I loved it would do it every day of the week and I got the opportunity to travel around the US as part of the tour. I had a dream at the time of being a backup dancer for a singer that’s really what I hoped to do. My brother Kevin played American football and he recognised that I also wanted to be part of something else. He convinced me to come try out athletics. I am so glad that I did.I tried all the events at the start literally cracked the high jump bar the first time. Track was challenging but it was only when the throwers had their annual spaghetti dinner that I went and tried it and found that I had a knack for something I never imagined. I thought of it as dance at first. Your left arm goes here your right leg goes here like a choreography when you were in the ring. And I also loved that there was something that was so data driven you could tell when you put in hard work that you improved. You could track that whether it was a foot or 20 cm exciting that you put in the work and the result speaks for itself. It’s a truth teller of where you are and how much effort you are willing to give.How excited are you to be part of the VDHM?Anyone who runs is so inspiring to me. To see 35000 people do it I can’t wait to be a part of the event. This will be the first half marathon I’ll be attending in person. I have obviously been at so many competitions but this is definitely outside my wheelhouse and that is something that I love. I love exploring new things and this is kind of like the ultimate of that.ALSO WATCHIndia batters embarrass in Bengaluru | What's happening at Delhi Capitals? | Beyond the Boundary""]",,,

BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKELearn about hotel management diplomahotel management diploma | Search AdsLearn More“No doubt it is hotter than we expected. We moved back the timings to provide the runners a nice experience. The half marathon for elite international and Indian runners usually started at 7:20 am on previous occasions. This time we have adjusted the timings and it will start at 6:50 am. Similarly the half marathon for amateurs previously began at around 6 am. This time it’s starting at 5 am. The Great Delhi Run saw a 9:30 am start. This year it will be 9 am. So the hotter weather conditions did play a part” Jones said.Jones a retired British long-distance runner spurred on the participants to break the course record. “There is always a tactical element involved in the race. It’s up to the participants how they personally approach the race. The opportunity is there to run faster if people want to. The change in the start timing is quite helpful. We have pushed everything a little earlier. So I hope the marathoners will look to break the course record.”Former 5000m world champion Muktar Edris will return to lead a star-studded international line-up at the VDHM. He will be joined by two-time Olympic gold medallist Joshua Cheptegei which increases expectations for a course record in the men’s race. The women’s field includes the Birmingham CWG champion in 10000m Eilish McColgan.“The course record is up for grabs. But I don’t see the world record being broken given there has been significant advances in marathon running” Jones said.At the VDHM the international event record stands in the name of Ethiopians Amdework Walelegn (58:53s year 2020) in the men’s section and Yalemzerf Yehualaw (1:04.46s year 2020) in the women’s category.'],,,,

So the season’s next target is Paralympics. If I am fit and injury-free I will definitely try bringing two gold medals for the country” Simran told SAI Media.Simran has been winning the National Championship and the Indian Open in both the 100m and 200m since 2022. She also won two silver medals in the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year. She also won three gold in the 100m 200m and long jump in the inaugural Khelo India Para Games in December 2023 and was inducted in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.Simran could have clinched gold in the 100m also but was disqualified due to a false start. This resulted in immense pressure for her to clinch the berth for Paralympics through the 200m race. Naturally she was glad to have booked her ticket to the French capital.“I always had this dream that I be the reason for playing our National Anthem in an international tournament like the World Championships. I got disqualified in 100m. Thereafter I competed in the 200m heats and made the semifinals where I came second. I was a bit nervous whether I would claim gold” she revealed.“I sat and recalled the number of times I got injured the challenges I faced through seven years before reaching this position. The intention was to give my best shot and I prayed God to give me the strength to fulfill everyone’s expectations. I took the lead on the bend itself and am very happy that I clinched the place for Paris” Simran said.Simran was born prematurely and spent the next 10 weeks in an incubator where it was discovered that she is visually impaired. Born to a medical practitioner Manoj Kumar and Savita Sharma a housewife Simran always knew that it was challenging to think of becoming a sportsperson.The Tokyo 2020 Paralympian’s tryst with the track began in her hometown Modinagar in Ghaziabad. “My father was bed-ridden for 14 to 15 years and my mother is a housewife so financially we were in very bad situation and thinking of pursuing sports as a career was very difficult” she said.However a meeting with her eventual husband Gajendra Singh at MM College grounds in Modinagar in 2015 helped her take up running. Gajendra worked on building her muscle strength and stamina before concentrating on her technique. There were times when they would request the Modinagar stadium to be available late in the night after he returned from work.The couple tied the knot in 2017 amid resistance from families. “When we went to train people used to tease me for being visually impaired and for running a pair of shorts. I realised that if I had the support of my husband I need nothing else” she said.In 2019 Simran competed in World Para Grand Prix to receive her T13 license. However Gajendra had to sell off a portion of his land to finance the license. He said he was glad that she had proved everyone who mocked her wrong. “When she won gold in Japan I told them all ‘My wife is a world champion’. I am sure she will make India proud” he said.“I am thankful to SAI and Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) for the support and for letting me compete in the Asian Para Games without selection trials. I was coming back from a hamstring injury suffered during the World Championships. But I clinched two silver medals in Hangzhou and that was a huge relief” Simran said.She now dreams of being in the Paralympic Games podium in just a few months.'],,,,

She did win two silver medals in the 2nd India Open International Boxing Tournament in 2019 and then in the Asian Championships in 2022.But that has been it.She has a chance though to redeem herself now and grab a berth for the Paris Olympics as she will take part in the second and final World Boxing Qualification Tournament in Bangkok Thailand starting Friday.In the last qualifier held in Busto Arsizio Italy Ankushita went down fighting 2-3 against Sonvico Emilie of France in the 66kg category. However this time she will be competing in the 60kg category and is quite confident of putting up a better show.""The fat percentage in my body was high earlier so I used to get fatigued easily but now with my weight coming down I am feeling better. I have also worked on my speed and strength"" said the 23-year-old during an interaction with TOI.Strangely enough she has adapted to the new weight category quite easily. ""I didn\'t have much of a problem in changing my category because my weight usually hovered around 63-64 kgs earlier. So right now thanks to the strict diet and discipline my weight has reduced to about 59 kg"" she added.She cut out sweets completely from her diet and stayed away from every kind of refreshment drink but it hasn\'t been much of a struggle for the 23-year-old who is trying to come out of her \'comfort zone\'.That\'s because earlier she used to train under her husband Trideep Borah who has been coaching her for a long time and she followed all his techniques. ""However now that he is in Pune I am learning a lot of different things from all the other coaches and that has been both helpful and challenging"" she explained.Although he isn\'t training her Trideep has been a constant support for Ankushita.""He keeps me motivated and supports me mentally as much as possible. Especially after the last Olympic qualifier where I lost he kept pushing me to do better. Incidentally he has more belief in me than I have in myself"" she added.And it\'s not only him but her entire family that keeps pushing her.Besides her family she also gets a lot of support from Olympic bronze medalist and fellow Assam boxer Lovlina Borgohain. The two had stayed together when they went to train in Montenegro and it was then that they became good friends.""She keeps telling me to never give up and to always keep fighting"" said Ankushita.Hopefully she will be able to do that in what will be only her second international competition this year. Even last year she took part in only one international meet - the Strandja Memorial in Bulgaria in February.She did train in China ahead of the Asian Games at which she was not a participant but not competing frequently outside India did have an effect on her confidence during the last qualifier.But losing weight and then working on the technicalities has given her the much-needed boost to secure a place in the Olympics. To achieve that she will have to finish among the top-three boxers in her category. It won\'t be easy but with all the top boxers in her weight category already qualified she does have a good chance.']",,,,

She said she will look to play from a close distance rather than just counterattacking her opponent in Paris. “I am playing from a close distance these days. I have been a counterattacking boxer but this time I have worked on how to play a close boxing game (narrowing the distance between a boxer and his/her opponent). Also I will look to win my bouts through unanimous voting and not wait for split decisions. That situation can be really tricky. Like at the Asian Games I was playing good but due to a little mistake in the semis I lost due to a split verdict. I don’t want to be in such a situation again” she added.Nikhat informed that she will next compete at the Elorda Cup in Kazakhstan from May 12 to 19 and then move on to Germany for the Olympic training camp after a brief stay in India. “We went to Türkiye for a preparatory camp where we sparred with local pugilists and boxers from Italy. It was a good experience. Elorda Cup will be our last competition before heading to Paris. So after competing there we will come back to India and then leave for Germany for the Olympic camp.”Nikhat rued the fact that no Indian male boxer has so far qualified for the Paris Games and hoped that some of them would be able to win quota places in Thailand. “Being a boxer I feel sad to see this situation. There’s another qualifier coming for which the team will be leaving on Friday. So it’s not the end of the road for our male boxers. Hopefully some of them will qualify” she said.'],,,,

The early stages of the match were evenly balanced between the two teams. About 20 minutes in -- halfway through the time control (as each player had 20 minutes for their moves) -- computer evaluations showed equality across the boards.The first to break through was Richard Rapport of the Pipers who launched a vicious attack on Teimour Radjabov leaving him with no escape. Soon after former women's world champions Hou Yifan and Alexandra Kosteniuk agreed to a draw giving Pipers a 4-1 lead.The other four boards went down to the wire.After testing his opponent in the middlegame Carlsen managed to find a weakness in Firouzja's position to gain the upper hand.

This critical victory gave Triveni four points and the lead in the match.R Pragnanandhaa then fell to Wei Yi on board two further strengthening Triveni's command of the match.Shortly after the Pipers crumbled on the remaining boards handing Triveni a stunning victory.Viswanathan Anand's Ganges Grandmasters stumbleFive-time world champion Viswanathan Anand went down to former world blitz champion Maxime Vachier-Lagrave as upGrad Mumba Masters registered a 14-5 win over Ganges Grandmasters.Both teams came into this match seeking their first win having lost their opening games by identical scores. The headline icon matchup on board one pitted the Anand against Vachier-Lagrave.Despite holding a better position Anand blundered a tactical sacrifice allowing Vachier-Lagrave to turn the tables.Although facing time pressure the French star tapped into his blitz champion instincts tightening his control over the game and ultimately clinching a vital victory.upGrad Mumba Masters who played the match as Black - took control from there with a win on the youngsters' board and a draw on the second women's board pushing them into the lead.Ganges Grandmasters couldn't catch a break and despite world number three Arjun Erigaisi's best efforts he could only manage a draw against Vidit Gujrathi despite being ahead on the clock.The situation worsened when Koneru Humpy overcame Vaishali R clinching the match for the upGrad Mumba Masters.While Parham Maghsoodloo secured a hard-fought victory against Peter Svidler to salvage some pride for the Ganges it wasn't enough to save them from a 14-5 defeat.With the upGrad Mumba Masters claiming their first points Ganges Grandmasters face an uphill battle after back-to-back losses.The situation is even worse because this is their second defeat with white pieces. They'll need to regroup quickly if they hope to stay in contention for the top places.Anish Giri holds Hikaru Nakamura to a drawEarlier in the day PBG Alaskan Knights took on the American Gambits with the former playing with white pieces.On board one - icon players Anish Giri (Alaskan Knights) and Hikaru Nakamura (American Gambits) drew their game despite a lot of options on the board to consider.When asked if they are happy with the outcome both confirmed but Nakamura noted it was Giri's choice to go for a draw. As the match progressed this turned out to be a good call for Giri as his teammates secured four victories (on the youngsters board the women's boards and one of the superstar boards) and one more draw for a convincing score of 14-2.After this round PBG Alaskan Knights emerged as the sole leaders of the tournament with six match points while the American Gambits remained on three.""]",,,,

""We also have a challenge (in Maharashtra) to stop some players from concentrating on academics and encourage some to take up academics by leaving chess.""On why associations or the system cannot produce chess players in India like private coaching he said: ""The problem for institutionalized coaching is raising funds and not getting the same level of players. You need 6-8 players above Elo 2400 (to make GM training feasible). Many state associations don\'t have those many top-ranked players.""Yes the AICF can do it. But the top-level players will never be a part of it. They cannot prepare together because they are competitors. They won\'t share their preparation on round-the-year-basis.""About the women\'s Olympiad campaign Kunte said the team was confident but it was also a question of having energy at the end. ""The team lost out on experience after Humpy\'s withdrawal due to personal reasons. D Harika decided to play at the last minute.""Like in 2022 the women\'s team won the first seven rounds and then suffered blips (defeat to Poland in R8 and draw with USA in R9).""Resting Harika after the Poland defeat was tricky. When good positions are not converted players start to lose confidence. I had to drop either Vaishali or Harika for the USA clash. Since Harika is more experienced I had to gamble on her coming good or recovering better after the rest. She needed to make her thoughts (after the rest) aligned with the team goals. But not resting Vaishali meant she had to play three successive rounds with black pieces.""Kunte added that the next round against China (which India won) became a tough situation again.""Vaishali lost her second game in a row (vs USA) and she was destroyed. On the other hand Divya was winning clean but Vantika\'s games were not clean.""I was nervous for the penultimate round - whether to drop Vaishali or not. Apart from losing the two preceding games she was also exhausted. Though this was not said in as many words one player did not want to play (Vaishali) and one player was very eager to play (Tania) in R10. We could see that from their faces and body language. I had to make a decision where both could be unhappy (laughs). But luckily that decision to play Vaishali proved correct.""Kunte who has planned his post playing career remarkably well with forays in coaching administration and politics talked candidly about court cases and sports code.""That will be a part of the system. Any association will face internal issues compliance issues different and bizarre court orders on various subjects"" he said.""I work with many sports being a manager at Indian Oil. And every sport is suffering because of non-clarity due to lack of understanding of the Sports Code and a number of court orders. I don\'t think govt can be happy with the situation if they want to host the 2036 Summer Olympics. Somebody has to intervene and break this stalemate.

This remarkable feat accomplished on Sunday marks a watershed moment in the country's chess history and solidifies India's position as a global powerhouse in the sport.The Indian open team led by the prodigious talents of Gukesh D Praggnanandhaa R and Arjun Erigaisi dominated the tournament with an impressive 21 out of 22 match points.TOP PICKS FOR YOUWatch: Team India celebrates historic Chess Olympiad double gold in style fans draw parallels with Rohit Sharma's 'walk' at T20 World Cup'We were in celebration mode since yesterday': D Gukesh after India win Chess Olympiad goldTheir final round victory against Slovenia with a convincing 3.5-0.5 score was a testament to their unwavering focus and competitive spirit.The women's team featuring seasoned players like Harika Dronavalli alongside rising stars such as Divya Deshmukh secured their gold with a crucial win against Azerbaijan in the final round amassing 19 match points.This double triumph is not merely a statistical achievement but a culmination of years of strategic investment in chess development in India. The legacy of Viswanathan Anand India's first Grandmaster and former world champion is evident in the success of the current generation. Three of the open team's top players - Gukesh Praggnanandhaa and Arjun - are products of the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA) an initiative spearheaded by Anand himself to nurture young talent.  BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-RoadThe rapid rise of these young players is particularly noteworthy. Gukesh at just 18 years old remained undefeated throughout the Olympiad and even scored a victory against Fabiano Caruana a former world championship contender. Arjun Erigaisi's ascent to the world's top three players behind only Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura further underscores the depth of talent in the Indian team.This success story is even more impressive considering the challenges posed by the global pandemic in recent years. Despite the disruptions these young prodigies have not only continued their development but have surpassed expectations with some now boasting higher ratings than Anand himself.The women's team's performance was equally stellar with 18-year-old Divya Deshmukh emerging as a standout player. Her unbeaten run and crucial victory in the final match earned her an individual gold medal on board three highlighting the bright future of women's chess in India.The Olympiad itself was a monumental event featuring a record-breaking 193 teams in the Open section and 181 in the Women's competition. This level of participation underscores the global appeal of chess and the prestige associated with the Olympiad.While India's triumph was the headline story the battle for silver and bronze medals in both sections was fiercely contested. In the Open category five teams tied for second place with 17 points with the USA and Uzbekistan ultimately securing silver and bronze respectively after tiebreaks. The women's section saw Kazakhstan claim silver while Team USA edged out Spain Armenia and Georgia for bronze in another tight contest.This double gold medal performance represents a significant improvement from India's bronze medals in both sections at the 2022 Olympiad held in Mamallapuram Chennai. The progression from bronze to gold in just two years reflects the rapid development and growing confidence of Indian chess.Looking ahead the chess community in India and beyond is now eagerly anticipating the World Chess Championship later this year where Gukesh will have the opportunity to compete against China’s Ding Liren for the world title. A victory there would cap off an extraordinary year for Indian chess and potentially usher in a new era of dominance.The success of the Indian teams at the 2024 Chess Olympiad is not just a triumph of individual talent but a testament to the country's systematic approach to nurturing chess excellence. From grassroots development to high-performance training academies India has created a robust ecosystem that is now bearing fruit on the global stage. As the chess world looks on it's clear that India's ascendancy in the sport is no fleeting phenomenon but the dawn of a new chess superpower.(The writer is a Mumbai based tech entrepreneur and an avid chess enthusiast)""]",,,,

It tells the inferior performer that he is not good enough.You can hide behind the lack of execution in other sports while consoling yourself that your understanding was not inferior. But not in chess. And the hardest part about the sport is to accept that you have lost fair and square. Hence many chess players have a somewhat valid reason for being emotional and egoistic.But behind that self-centred mind could lie the appreciator of artistry aesthetics and class.And sometimes that love trumps self-love.Peter Prohaszka (representing hosts Hungary 'B' team) proved that when he allowed India's Erigaisi Arjun to checkmate him in the third round of Chess Olympiad in Budapest on Friday. He doffed his hat to Arjun's genius and did not turn poorer for doing it.Allowing the opponent to come up with a nice finishing touch is not easy in any sport. For example a bowler would try to deny the batsman a much needed hundred (sometimes even by bowling a wide when a run is needed for a win) and a moment of personal glory by dismissing him.Chess has a provision for resignation - once you accept that you are losing or have realised the same - the game can be stopped then and there with a handshake.Unlike other sports a chess game doesn't need to complete either victory or the designated duration of the match. Moves in a beautiful endgame either with equally teasing counterplay or not are not played on the board majority of times (due the resignation) and hence not recorded. They remain plausible posterity hidden in imagination thus denying them to be a part of history and documentation.Prohaszka's magnanimous act of not resigning but allowing a checkmate on Friday against Arjun is not utterly rare in the 64-square sport but not too frequent either.Russia's Peter Svidler deliberately allowed Magnus Carlsen a checkmate with a pawn push in the Grenke Classic of 2019 in Baden-Baden Germany. He also came up with a wry smile afterwards.Stalemate in which both players get half point each as the king is trapped without squares but without check and other pieces cannot move is a poor cousin of the beautiful checkmate.Sometimes a point given - by getting checkmated in case of chess - can underscore a larger point. That of upholding the sense of beauty higher and protecting the very ethos of the sport.Prohaszaka's act showed that in ample measure and made the followers of the sport richer and fall in love with the chequered life once again.""]",,,,

The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves are set to face off in the first of two preseason games in the United Arab Emirates capital showcasing the growing influence of the league in the region.However while the on-court action takes centre stage the real game-changer is happening off the court. Qatar\'s sovereign wealth fund has made headlines with its purchase of a minority stake in the Washington Wizards marking a significant move less than a year after the NBA\'s Board of Governors opened the door to institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds.Notably NBA superstar LeBron James recently visited Saudi Arabia sparking further interest in the region. The visit followed a social media comment by James where he humorously mentioned he would consider the astronomical offers being made to attract football stars to Saudi Arabia.The NBA\'s ties with the Arabian Gulf have been growing stronger. Last year the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks played preseason games in Abu Dhabi after the league signed a multiyear partnership with the emirate\'s department of culture and tourism. It marked the first time the NBA hosted games in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf also known as the Persian Gulf.Mark Tatum NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating officer emphasized the league\'s commitment to expanding its presence in the region: ""We felt that bringing the live NBA experience to fans in Abu Dhabi was the next step in our ongoing efforts to grow the game in the region.""In November 2022 the NBA\'s board of governors made a significant decision allowing passive non-controlling minority investments in NBA teams by institutional investors including university endowments foreign and domestic pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. These investments are subject to league review and NBA Board approval.Qatar Investment Authority\'s acquisition of a roughly 5% stake in the parent company of the Washington Wizards Washington Capitals and Washington Mystics has already received NBA approval setting a precedent for similar agreements in the future.Tatum highlighted the increasing value of NBA teams and the global appeal of the league anticipating continued interest from institutional investors worldwide. However he clarified that while the NBA seeks to engage international fans through games played abroad the league does not necessarily endorse or agree with every law or viewpoint in host countries. He emphasized their commitment to adhering to U.S. government guidance and staying true to the NBA\'s mission and values.While Saudi Arabia with its sovereign wealth fund has made significant investments in professional golf and football it has not initiated talks with the NBA about investing in teams. Additionally the NBA has not discussed holding preseason games in Saudi Arabia.As part of the NBA\'s presence in Abu Dhabi the league plans to conduct youth clinics and host fan events featuring players from the Mavericks and Timberwolves as well as NBA legends such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The preseason games will be held at Etihad Arena on Yas Island where the NBA opened an NBA Store last year.Following the Abu Dhabi games the Dallas Mavericks will travel to Spain for a preseason matchup against Real Madrid next Tuesday continuing their global outreach efforts.(With AP inputs)']",,,,

They would not be able to challenge without a timeout available.Teams can continue to keep the timeout after a first challenge if successful but will not retain the timeout used for a second challenge whether or not it is successful.""]",,,

Such players will be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul which will not count as a personal foul or result in ejection.Under these rules the opposing team will receive one free throw and gain possession of the ball.Officials will not be required to halt live play to assess a flopping violation; instead they can wait for the next ""neutral opportunity"" to pause the game and apply the penalty.The league has stated that these proposed flopping penalty rules will be in effect on a provisional basis throughout the summer league games taking place this year. The summer league which commenced on Monday and spans the next two weeks in Sacramento Salt Lake City and Las Vegas will serve as a testing ground for the new regulations.Since 2012 the NBA has primarily relied on public warnings and occasional fines to address flopping but there have been no specific in-game penalties for such actions. Currently if the league determines that a player has flopped a warning is issued followed by escalating fines for subsequent violations.(AI image)When initially determining fines for flopping in 2012 the NBA defined a flop as ""an attempt to either fool referees into calling undeserved fouls or fool fans into thinking the referees missed a foul call by exaggerating the effect of contact with an opposing player.""For the penalty to be enforced in the upcoming 2023-24 season or future seasons it must receive approval from the NBA Board of Governors.(With agency inputs)']",,,,

Babuta scored 208.4 points just 1.4 points short of the bronze medal. Croatia\'s Miran Maricic took third place with 209.8 points.Babuta started strong shooting a 10.7 and initially took the lead. His first 10 shots totaled 105.0 points putting him in third place behind China\'s Lihao Sheng with 105.8 points and Maricic with 105.1 points.However Babuta\'s performance dropped with a 9.9 on his 13th shot and a 9.5 on his 20th and final shot which led to him missing the podium.Babuta reflected on his Olympics experience and shared his thoughts during the crucial shot emphasising his focus on the process and technical aspects. Despite his best efforts he missed which kept him from securing a podium finish.""A lot of thoughts were going through my mind while I was loading my weapon; expectations were there. I was talking to myself telling myself that I just needed to focus on the process. I had to deliver this shot with the hundred per cent that I know and that this might be my last shot"" Arjun said.Arjun said he was concentrating on one shot at a time and intended to maintain that approach. However after missing the shot neither he nor his support staff could pinpoint the reason.""I don’t know why it went out; I have no idea and no one else does either including my coaches and the other support staff"" he stated.When asked about the importance of skill versus handling pressure at the Olympic level Arjun highlighted the need for both.He said ""Technically you’re fine because you’ve reached that level. You’ve competed in four Olympic trials and got selected for the Olympics but I think we need to maintain that technical aspect and focus more on other aspects such as being mentally aware keeping ourselves away from social media and staying in the present with the process planning and execution.""(AFP photo)Arjun also cautioned to steer clear of distractions in the Olympic environment. ""I would emphasise managing everything around that aura because there’s a lot of \'chaka chaund\' during that time (Olympics). You just need to stay away from all those distractions"" the 25-year-old advised.Arjun shared his mantra: ""We just need to focus on the process and leave expectations and results aside.""The event was a disappointment for Arjun but he found solace in knowing he gave his best. ""I had given my hundred per cent for that shot too (last shot)"" he expressed.Babuta will now shift focus to the ISSF World Cup Finals at the Karni Singh Shooting Range in Delhi from October 13-18. This event will include top pistol rifle and shotgun shooters aiming to be the year’s best.ISSF World Cup Finals participants include medalists from the 12 individual shooting events at the Paris Olympics and title winners from last year\'s event in Doha Qatar.The top six shooters in the ISSF World Cup rankings will also compete with no more than two shooters per country in each event.

Swapnil\'s medal came after 72 years.State govt had announced a Rs 1cr award a day after Swapnil won the bronze but it hasn\'t been communicated to him officially.\'Special package\' yet to be announcedThe Pune-based shooter Swapnil said he got to know about the prize money from newspapers.While there was no official felicitation programme organized by govt state minister Chandrakant Patil said govt was planning to offer a big govt post to Swapnil and that they were readying a ""special package"" for him. He said this at a function hosted by Gagan Narang\'s Gun For Glory academy in Balewadi. However Patil was unavailable when TOI tried to contact him for his response to Kusale\'s comment.While there\'s no sign of the \'special package\' the shooter who is a Railways employee said he was told to apply for a regular state govt job.

During the Ganesh festival Swapnil and his friend met CM Eknath Shinde requesting an increase in the amount declared by the state govt but nothing has happened yet"" he said.Haryana has already transferred the award money to the athletes accounts. With two bronze Manu got Rs 2.5 crore for each medal while Neeraj Chopra who won silver got Rs 4 crore. Shooter Sarabjot who won mixed bronze with Manu got Rs 2.5 crore. Wrestler Vinesh who was disqualified from the final and lost her silver was treated as a silver medallist and also got Rs 4 crore.']",,,

BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-RoadLearn MoreThanking the audience for a warm welcome Manu said ""For me the target will be the journey to gold in the Olympic games so the next thing will be LA for me. However I am on a short break for now. It\'s been eight and a half years that I took a break from my sport. So right now is the time when I\'m like 3 months 4 months (break) I will take and then start back with my training again for LA 2028.And all the competitions in between I am like it\'s just a milestone and the further goal will beLA 2028 for me. And right now also I am enjoying everything I mean I am getting to dress up and all (giggles) so it\'s fun and games.""Manu was then asked to reflect on one of her recent quotes where she had said that one can become an engineer or a doctor whichever respective field you want to excel in and so is with sport that has so much to offer in today\'s times but does any other profession has the pain the offer the way sport does because if things don\'t work like what happened in Tokyo it can be pretty painful.Manu said ""It can be (painful) but I believe that when you have really invested in something when something is really close to your heart for example for me it\'s my sport I am really connected to it emotionally physically mentally so it will cause pain when sometimes you are not able to deliver to the level that you have been expecting. So for some of the people it will be sport for some it will be education for some it will be business. So whenever you have really invested in something and you are not really able to deliver to your levels that will cause a lot of pain. And sports I believe gave me an opportunity to travel the world which I really really enjoyed so I would really be like \'go into sports but also you have to balance your studies and everything\'. Everything is really important you can\'t be like just sports or just activities or just studies it should be a balance in life.""(TOI Photo)On being asked how lonely a sport like shooting can get Manu said ""We (shooters) find our interests in it for me my sport gives me kick. For example if I am shooting in some event and I do not win so for the next event for me it will be like \'I have to win I have to win in the next competition\'. The mistakes I made I should learn from them and not repeat in the next one. So we set short-term goals for the very next competition or the next year\'s competitions. In beginning shooting can be really really boring for some people but once you start to get a hold of it I am sure it\'s really interesting for a hobby also. It can be really interesting to keep your mind off things. So I really enjoy it and I would ask you all whenever you come to the ranges if you get time please try shooting it\'s a very good stress reliever as well.""On being asked if her hobbies that she has been cultivating apart from shooting sketching horse riding playing the violin reading are really hobbies or coping mechanisms to cope with shooting Manu said ""For me they are just hobbies because I really enjoy doing different things I mean we all should find time for ourselves to be able to do things that we really like. Some people like to try different sports for example on Sundays they go for a run for a football match or something some people go for movies and all. You should definitely find time for yourself definitely devote atleast five hours or so every week for yourself and it\'ll make you feel really good. For me it\'s trying different sports different activities it\'s really fun and easy. You should enjoy what you do and if you find out time for yourself even like 5-6 hours every week it\'ll really elevate your mood and it\'ll really be able to help you focus better in what you\'re doing in your life.""Manu was then asked what was more difficult finding motivation after Tokyo or staying motivated now after this kind of a high that she sees.Manu replies ""I believe both of those situations like the one that I had after Tokyo it took a toll on me I was really really heartbroken I was like next time I have to win and I must win but during the process as soon as Tokyo ended I was really motivated for the next Olympic games but 2022 and 2023 showed me a really tough time. So coping up at that time was really difficult for me but I was like that just put in your honest hard work and just let it be. I would like to share this with you all that before Paris Olympics I was not able to win any major medal in any event. I was winning team medals but not individual medals so I was really not confident before entering Paris 2024 but my coach and my family were like \'you must deliver what you\'ve learnt you must try to do your best in this event and just let it be. You will win a medal.\' He (the coach) was really confident in me but I was not but when you are really focused in your process I am sure you will get the results as well.""On being asked to talk about her going back to academics as athletes across sports struggle with their careers post retirement and by going back to academics she is really setting a benchmark for younger kids Manu said ""I never left studies. I come from a family of engineers professors teachers and all so it\'s like I have this kind of pressure when I am in studies in schools or colleges. So there is this little pressure that if you fail it\'s not going to look good on your profile. I don\'t want to be tagged like \'she failed this class you\'re off the college\'. So I would not like do that and my tutors really help me with that and I believe that you should be able to balance everything in your life. One thing cannot take you as far as you would want to go so for me it\'s like when I get free time out of sport I really enjoy studying as well and my tutors really help me with that.""Manu was then asked to talk about her life as a teenager during which youngsters tend to hang around with friends and she was practicing shooting at the range.Manu replies ""I am sure many people like to enjoy their teenage years hanging out with friends or going for a movie but for me it was never really the case. I was actually not able to make friends because I was not really around in school times or college times so I was mostly out for shooting competitions for the country and I think at that time when I was 16-17-18 years old the major thing that really inspired me and motivated me and that kept me going was that if I lose one competition I would be really pissed off I would be like \'how could you lose how are you not able to win this competition\' so that would really trigger me it would actually trigger me a lot and then if I win a competition I would be like \'you have to repeat it you have to do it again.\' So that was my motivation that really kept me going when I was 16-17-18-19 but right now I am more patient with things like \'OK you will win when you will just keep going with the flow and keep putting your hard work.\' I also enjoy watching movies and all with my family and friends I take out time as I mentioned earlier I take out time for my hobbies I take out time to spend with my family and as a human being that is the foremost priority we should have spending time with your family and giving yourself time as well that\'ll really really help you mentally physically and to go in a longer run in your careers.""Manu was then asked if she was a product of the system because champions have gone on to become what they\'ve become apropos the system like in some ways there are athletes who have benefitted from the system and then there are athletes who have gone on to succeed regardless of what the system has provided what does she look at herself as.Manu answers ""We all come across several challenging moments in our lives and in our careers for me also sometimes it was really challenging for me to be able to alongwith the system sometimes the system really helped me to actually achieve something in life like win some competition or qualify for some events or competitions. So it was both actually the system helped me also and when it was challenging for me. For example before the Paris Olympics we had 4-5 sets of trials and I was shooting in three events it was really hectic for me. It was challenging but it really made me strong and I came out stronger and actually it really helped me in Paris as well. So I don\'t think we can always have everything how we want them to be sometimes life will throw really hard times at you sometimes it\'ll be really difficult for you all it was for me as well but that time will really make you stronger and I can\'t say I am a product of something or not but everything that has happened in my life really made me who I am today and I am really grateful that it had happened.""On being asked about the small struggles that a shooter faces like importing a gun and whether things have improved Manu said ""Initially I did face this challenge that I was not really able to get a license to import a pistol but sooner the things were addressed and I also got help from the government and from the media people specially the media was the body that really helped me with getting a license for the first time when I had to import the pistol so everything can be useful I never imagined I will have such good relations with media people in the longer term and definitely I believe that challenges will help you get stronger in life. There\'s a saying that God will throw challenges at you thinking that you are capable of overcoming that and becoming even stronger. So just face the challenges whatever there are in your lives and I am sure some people have it even tougher challenges in lives but they\'ll make us stronger.""(TOI Photo)Manu was then asked how emotionally fragile shooters\' life can be and how she stays away from anything that can negatively impact her as it\'s such a mental thing.Manu replies ""Yes it gets boring at times for me as well even now. My sport has taught me so much of patience earlier I was a really impulsive person. I would really react to things quickly specially when I was into boxing and karate I was so impulsive in nature I was like if it\'s getting out of my hands I would react immediately. Bit this sport has taught me lot of patience and I would say that you should actually stick by what you really like in life. Shooting I really love I really enjoy playing my sport so I think I am gonna stick by for a really long time and will try for as long as it\'s possible for me for as long as I love my sport and we should all try to give our best in our fields. And India has so much of potential 1.5 billion people now and we all have so much of talent so much of potential in the coming years I think we can dominate in many many different segments of life segments of career.""Before ending the session Manu added ""Paralympics have just begun and Indians are also doing well let\'s all support our Paralympians let\'s cheer for them root for them we hope they bring as many medals as possible for our country and shine brighter.""']",,,,
