She prefers meeting friends spending time with family and travelling and not just restricting herself to a rigorous training regime or following meticulously planned diets and being confined to the track and field arena. The American discus throw champion spoke about the influence India’s very own double Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra has had on her career.Excerpts from an interview:This is your first time to India...I am so excited to be in India. It’s honestly been on my bucket list of places I wanted to come and to have a purpose. This has always been a country I’ve wanted to come to and to travel in and I’m so grateful that finally there’s an opportunity to be here. To be here I think makes life extra meaningful. I would love to try Indian chaat visit India Gate explore the local markets and if time provided travel to Taj Mahal.Our own double Olympic medallist javelin champion Neeraj Chopra recently welcomed you to India on Instagram...Neeraj is very kind and shy which you would not expect for him to be obviously being such a huge hero and superstar here. But I think it’s stars like him that people respect the most. They are confident and certain enough in themselves that they don’t have to be so boisterous. Neeraj’s achievements as an Olympic champion have inspired me a lot. When he competes it’s way more than about himself. You can really feel the pride of his country what he does and his devotion and craftsmanship. What he has done for India it’s inspiring for athletes world over.I feel my accomplishment of being the first American to win two gold medals as a field athlete is nothing compared to his first gold in athletics for an entire nation. He is incredibly inspiring one of the most fantastic ambassadors for athletics. We first met and chatted at the 2022 Diamond League Finals in Brussels where we both won the title trophy. I put out an Instagram story of coming here and right away he messaged me saying ‘Welcome to India’.How does it feel like being a two-time Olympic champion and the first American woman to be double medallist in the world championships?It took me a long time before I thought discus would be a career. It’s such a niche thing there’s only five to eight women in the entire world that can truly make it a career. And for a long time it was just something that I enjoyed doing. It’s still hard to believe that I am a twotime Olympic champion. I feel really proud about it. When I think back I will feel so proud of the medals. Those moments are the ones I will cherish for life.You started as a dancer – ballet hip-hop and contemporary dance – taking up track and field in high school and you are two-time Olympic champion today...My journey can definitely be summarised as unfolding in ways I never imagined possible. I started with dance and that really became my passion when I was a teenager. I loved it would do it every day of the week and I got the opportunity to travel around the US as part of the tour. I had a dream at the time of being a backup dancer for a singer that’s really what I hoped to do. My brother Kevin played American football and he recognised that I also wanted to be part of something else. He convinced me to come try out athletics. I am so glad that I did.I tried all the events at the start literally cracked the high jump bar the first time. Track was challenging but it was only when the throwers had their annual spaghetti dinner that I went and tried it and found that I had a knack for something I never imagined. I thought of it as dance at first. Your left arm goes here your right leg goes here like a choreography when you were in the ring. And I also loved that there was something that was so data driven you could tell when you put in hard work that you improved. You could track that whether it was a foot or 20 cm exciting that you put in the work and the result speaks for itself. It’s a truth teller of where you are and how much effort you are willing to give.How excited are you to be part of the VDHM?Anyone who runs is so inspiring to me. To see 35000 people do it I can’t wait to be a part of the event. This will be the first half marathon I’ll be attending in person. I have obviously been at so many competitions but this is definitely outside my wheelhouse and that is something that I love. I love exploring new things and this is kind of like the ultimate of that.ALSO WATCHIndia batters embarrass in Bengaluru | What's happening at Delhi Capitals? | Beyond the Boundary"]

I never tried to compare myself with the likes of Virat Kohli or MS Dhoni because I\'m very well aware of the reality of what I am in India" he said."Yes obviously after the Olympics people recognize me a lot more but I know there is a stark difference in my popularity compared to that of a cricketer. Cricket is played in every single alley in the country. It\'s not like people practise javelin throw in the same way" the javelin ace added."I don\'t want any shortcuts to make my sport popular. I want my sport to become popular with my hard work and effort.""If there are more javelin-based competitions in India like the Diamond League people will become more interested in watching and following the sport. With talented javelin athletes in India there should be national-level leagues to compete. This would help to boost the sport in India" he further said.Neeraj will lead Indian contingent of 118 athletes in the Paris Olympics starting July 26.']

Coached by her husband Gajendra Singh who works for Army Service Corps she trains regularly at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.Simran’s hard work and resilience helped her overcome physical and socio-economic challenges and clinch the T12 200m gold in style at the Worlds.The 26-year-old emerged winner in 24.95 seconds an improvement from her previous personal best time of 25.16 seconds.Not one to rest on her laurels Simran targets podium finishes in the T-12 100m and 200m sprints at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games scheduled from August 28 to September 8. “My coach’s suggestion is that once an event is completed I should look at the next one” she said recalibrating her targets.“He told me now that the World Championships is over start training for the next major event. So the season’s next target is Paralympics. If I am fit and injury-free I will definitely try bringing two gold medals for the country” Simran told SAI Media.Simran has been winning the National Championship and the Indian Open in both the 100m and 200m since 2022. She also won two silver medals in the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year. She also won three gold in the 100m 200m and long jump in the inaugural Khelo India Para Games in December 2023 and was inducted in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.Simran could have clinched gold in the 100m also but was disqualified due to a false start. This resulted in immense pressure for her to clinch the berth for Paralympics through the 200m race. Naturally she was glad to have booked her ticket to the French capital.“I always had this dream that I be the reason for playing our National Anthem in an international tournament like the World Championships. I got disqualified in 100m. Thereafter I competed in the 200m heats and made the semifinals where I came second. I was a bit nervous whether I would claim gold” she revealed.“I sat and recalled the number of times I got injured the challenges I faced through seven years before reaching this position. The intention was to give my best shot and I prayed God to give me the strength to fulfill everyone’s expectations. I took the lead on the bend itself and am very happy that I clinched the place for Paris” Simran said.Simran was born prematurely and spent the next 10 weeks in an incubator where it was discovered that she is visually impaired. Born to a medical practitioner Manoj Kumar and Savita Sharma a housewife Simran always knew that it was challenging to think of becoming a sportsperson.The Tokyo 2020 Paralympian’s tryst with the track began in her hometown Modinagar in Ghaziabad. “My father was bed-ridden for 14 to 15 years and my mother is a housewife so financially we were in very bad situation and thinking of pursuing sports as a career was very difficult” she said.However a meeting with her eventual husband Gajendra Singh at MM College grounds in Modinagar in 2015 helped her take up running. Gajendra worked on building her muscle strength and stamina before concentrating on her technique. There were times when they would request the Modinagar stadium to be available late in the night after he returned from work.The couple tied the knot in 2017 amid resistance from families. “When we went to train people used to tease me for being visually impaired and for running a pair of shorts. I realised that if I had the support of my husband I need nothing else” she said.In 2019 Simran competed in World Para Grand Prix to receive her T13 license. However Gajendra had to sell off a portion of his land to finance the license. He said he was glad that she had proved everyone who mocked her wrong. “When she won gold in Japan I told them all ‘My wife is a world champion’. I am sure she will make India proud” he said.“I am thankful to SAI and Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) for the support and for letting me compete in the Asian Para Games without selection trials. I was coming back from a hamstring injury suffered during the World Championships. But I clinched two silver medals in Hangzhou and that was a huge relief” Simran said.She now dreams of being in the Paralympic Games podium in just a few months.']
