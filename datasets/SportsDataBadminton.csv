She joined BJP recently.', 'Saina Nehwal (Image credit: X)HYDERABAD: Has the world seen the last of shuttler Saina Nehwal in action? It appears so. “The knee is not very good. I have arthritis. My cartilage has gone to a bad state. It is very difficult to push for eight-nine hours” Saina said on the ‘House of Glory’ podcast produced by former Olympian shooter Gagan Narang and hosted by Timesofindia.com on Monday.Saina had first hinted at retirement on June 6 2023 when she lost to Ratchanok Intanon in the first round of Singapore Open. It was a troublesome knee and she told TOI last year that it needed to heal completely for her to compete again. On Monday came another admission that arthritis has taken a toll on her body and her game.

I think I will have to accept it somewhere. Because two hours of training is not good enough to play with the highest level of players and get the desired results. I am thinking about it. It will be sad because it is like a job that a normal person does. A sportsperson’s career is always a short one. I started at the age of 9” Saina said.

I am happy with what I have done and given it all” she said.Saina limped out of the second round of 2016 Olympics losing to little-known Maria Ulitina of Ukraine. She under -went a surgery on her right knee after that but it has been an uphill struggle ever since.She failed to qualify for the next two Olympics.“Competing at the Olympics is a child -hood dream for all.

It is not like you don’t want to play but your body is telling you that you are not doing well and you have injuries” said Saina.The only Indian woman to be ranked No.1 in the world Saina joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a few years back.Most top women shuttlers end their career be -tween 28 to 30.
