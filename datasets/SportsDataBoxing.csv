The event drew a passionate crowd of 96000 spectators.From the opening bell the 27-year-old champion asserted his dominance flooring the former two-time heavyweight titleholder on multiple occasions.Dubois had previously expressed his resolve to "legitimise" his reign as IBF champion having been awarded the title vacated by Oleksandr Usyk in June.The challenger\'s powerful performance raises serious doubts about Joshua\'s boxing future although his promoter Eddie Hearn indicated that he anticipates Joshua will seek a rematch.

Dubois floored him again in the third round with a left hook that caused his legs to give way.Following a standing eight count the bell rang and as the fourth round commenced Joshua hit the canvas for the third time despite his objection that it was not a valid knockdown.The fifth round was action-packed with Dubois briefly stunned by two right hands. As Joshua attempted to capitalize on the situation he was caught by consecutive right hands and found himself on the canvas once more this time unable to beat the count.Both boxers stepped into the ring with the goal of securing a chance to face Tyson Fury or Usyk for the undisputed world championship.Usyk achieved a historic feat in May by becoming the first boxer to hold all four major heavyweight titles simultaneously including the IBF WBO WBC and WBA belts after defeating Tyson Fury.Instead of facing the mandatory IBF challenger Dubois Usyk opted for a rematch with Fury. Dubois won the interim IBF title in June and was elevated to world champion status when Usyk vacated the belt.Joshua had aspirations of joining the prestigious group of three-time heavyweight champions which includes legendary figures such as Muhammad Ali Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield. However Joshua\'s career took a significant hit after suffering defeats against Andy Ruiz in 2019 and two subsequent losses to Usyk.Despite bouncing back with four consecutive victories Joshua aimed to reclaim his position at the top of the heavyweight division.Following his devastating loss to Dubois at Wembley which marked his fourth defeat in 32 professional bouts Joshua suggested he would continue his boxing career but the setback will undoubtedly require introspection and careful consideration of his future in the sport."We came up short as a team" he said.

She has made significant changes in her training and weight management to improve her performance.', 'Pic credit: XKOLKATA: Ankushita Boro won gold at the Youth Women\'s World Boxing Championship way back in 2017.However the Assam boxer failed to attain much success in the international arena at the senior level even as she kept winning medals in national events over the years. She did win two silver medals in the 2nd India Open International Boxing Tournament in 2019 and then in the Asian Championships in 2022.But that has been it.She has a chance though to redeem herself now and grab a berth for the Paris Olympics as she will take part in the second and final World Boxing Qualification Tournament in Bangkok Thailand starting Friday.In the last qualifier held in Busto Arsizio Italy Ankushita went down fighting 2-3 against Sonvico Emilie of France in the 66kg category. However this time she will be competing in the 60kg category and is quite confident of putting up a better show."The fat percentage in my body was high earlier so I used to get fatigued easily but now with my weight coming down I am feeling better. I have also worked on my speed and strength" said the 23-year-old during an interaction with TOI.Strangely enough she has adapted to the new weight category quite easily. "I didn\'t have much of a problem in changing my category because my weight usually hovered around 63-64 kgs earlier. So right now thanks to the strict diet and discipline my weight has reduced to about 59 kg" she added.She cut out sweets completely from her diet and stayed away from every kind of refreshment drink but it hasn\'t been much of a struggle for the 23-year-old who is trying to come out of her \'comfort zone\'.That\'s because earlier she used to train under her husband Trideep Borah who has been coaching her for a long time and she followed all his techniques. "However now that he is in Pune I am learning a lot of different things from all the other coaches and that has been both helpful and challenging" she explained.Although he isn\'t training her Trideep has been a constant support for Ankushita."He keeps me motivated and supports me mentally as much as possible. Especially after the last Olympic qualifier where I lost he kept pushing me to do better. Incidentally he has more belief in me than I have in myself" she added.And it\'s not only him but her entire family that keeps pushing her.Besides her family she also gets a lot of support from Olympic bronze medalist and fellow Assam boxer Lovlina Borgohain. The two had stayed together when they went to train in Montenegro and it was then that they became good friends."She keeps telling me to never give up and to always keep fighting" said Ankushita.Hopefully she will be able to do that in what will be only her second international competition this year. Even last year she took part in only one international meet - the Strandja Memorial in Bulgaria in February.She did train in China ahead of the Asian Games at which she was not a participant but not competing frequently outside India did have an effect on her confidence during the last qualifier.But losing weight and then working on the technicalities has given her the much-needed boost to secure a place in the Olympics. To achieve that she will have to finish among the top-three boxers in her category. It won\'t be easy but with all the top boxers in her weight category already qualified she does have a good chance.']

Also I will look to win my bouts through unanimous voting and not wait for split decisions. That situation can be really tricky. Like at the Asian Games I was playing good but due to a little mistake in the semis I lost due to a split verdict. I don’t want to be in such a situation again” she added.Nikhat informed that she will next compete at the Elorda Cup in Kazakhstan from May 12 to 19 and then move on to Germany for the Olympic training camp after a brief stay in India. “We went to Türkiye for a preparatory camp where we sparred with local pugilists and boxers from Italy. It was a good experience. Elorda Cup will be our last competition before heading to Paris. So after competing there we will come back to India and then leave for Germany for the Olympic camp.”Nikhat rued the fact that no Indian male boxer has so far qualified for the Paris Games and hoped that some of them would be able to win quota places in Thailand. “Being a boxer I feel sad to see this situation. There’s another qualifier coming for which the team will be leaving on Friday. So it’s not the end of the road for our male boxers. Hopefully some of them will qualify” she said.']

She is very intelligent. She has good ring tactics" he said.India could expect a second boxing medal in the women\'s event if Lovlina Borgohain who won the welterweight bronze at the Tokyo Olympics could find her "killer instinct" Fernandez said."Lovlina has to show more killer instinct" he said of the boxer who had to move from 69kg to 75kg after the Olympic categories were revised."I have seen some of her bouts and I think she lost them because Lovlina was not aggressive and proactive enough."If she can box to her potential she can finish among the medals in Paris."India has secured four spots for women in the Paris women\'s quota.Fernandez was optimistic that the male boxers would perform well in the international qualifiers in Bangkok where India might be able to secure nine berths in Paris."I reckon Nishant Dev and Amit Panghal can bag Paris quotas. They both have the potential to do this" he said."Men\'s boxing is very tough and should not be compared with women\'s where the competition is relatively easier."(With Reuters inputs)']
