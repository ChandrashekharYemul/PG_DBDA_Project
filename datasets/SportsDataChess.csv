She is now focused on becoming a Grandmaster possibly by next year despite the financial and logistical challenges of competing globally.“It has not at all been easy reaching this level because the culture here (in north India) is all about excelling in academics and if you want to play chess or any other sport you need to devote extra time to that” Vantika said. She recalls her school’s lack of interest in her achievements even in renowned institutions like Shri Ram College of Commerce.Vantika’s mother left her job to support her daughter. Vantika initially became interested in chess alongside other activities like karate and music. She eventually won her first prize money and continued pursuing chess.

She and her mother traveled nationwide for tournaments.Balancing academics and chess was tough. “I used to play a tournament come back and the next day I used to have some exam or something” Vantika recalled. Despite this she succeeded in both fields securing national titles and academic accolades.The COVID-19 pandemic allowed Vantika to hone her skills at home leading to a gold in the 2020 Online Chess Olympiad.

Her mother Sangeeta acknowledges the financial strain saying “Playing one tournament after another while also arranging the finances is a challenge in itself.”An online coaching session with a foreign grandmaster costs Rs 10000 per hour adding up to substantial expenses but Sangeeta focuses on Vantika’s potential. Keeping her motivated in the solitary world of chess is also challenging for her mother.Vantika remains hopeful and determined to become a Grandmaster soon. “I think if I keep trying my best I can even make it by next year” she signed off."]

Despite recent successes Gujrathi remains focused on achieving his ultimate goal of winning a world title.", 'Vidit Gujrathi. (PTI Photo)LONDON: After becoming a Grandmaster at the age of 16 and having achieved tremendous success over the years leading Indian chess player Vidit Gujrathi feels the sport has "lacked professionalism" in scheduling of events that more often than not adversely affects the players\' wellbeing.Gujrathi who was a part of India\'s gold-winning campaign in the Chess Olympiad recently says the sport\'s ecosystem needs a major overhaul to ensure players have more balance in life."Yeah it\'s not ideal because we are just playing back-to-back tournaments. It comes at the cost of let\'s say personal life or living in the comfort of your home. You are always on the go" Gujrathi told PTI on the sidelines of Global Chess League here."And it cannot be good for the physical body because you are not in one place. Your schedule is changing all the time. So there is that cost (we have to pay for playing chess).  BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-Road"I feel chess has always lacked a bit of professionalism when it comes to these things when it comes to scheduling and all that stuff. Like for example in any physical sport you will see that there are gap days in (between) tournaments. Because the physical body needs to recover."But here we are expected to run at 120 miles per hour every single day. It\'s not possible" said the 29-year-old Grandmaster who had qualified for the Candidates earlier this year in Toronto.He says that it\'s not just the international chess federation (FIDE) or the national federations around the world that need to bring about change but the entire ecosystem will have to take the initiative to improve the well-being of players."I cannot pinpoint one person or one entity. It\'s the ecosystem in general. It\'s just strange that there are no gap days. Like how do you recover? It\'s actually such a basic thought but nobody has given it enough attention."You can do sprints but you need that rest to sprint again. But that\'s not understood in this world when it comes to chess. So you are expected to perform at your best every single day without breaks" said Gujrathi who is only the fourth player in the country to have crossed the ELO rating threshold of 2700.Despite achieving several milestones including a men\'s team silver at the Hangzhou Asian Games gold at the Olympiad in Budapest recently and winning the FIDE Grand Swiss 2023 Gujrathi says these are just stepping stones to achieving the bigger goal of winning the world title."It\'s a good feeling (being part of the gold-winning team at the Olympiad) but nothing to be very happy about when I think of my own play. Because I have higher ambitions and I feel these things are just stepping stones."So it\'s (successes) just the feedback that something is working and probably there are a few things if I am able to consistently do the same performances then I will be happier. The way I played in the Grand Swiss 2023 where I played some of the best chess… I am seeking that form consistently."Gujrathi says he is still searching for the formula which will give him more consistency in his play."I am experimenting with many things trying to figure out what works or what doesn\'t. These experiments sometimes are costly because you don\'t know if it will work and you are taking some risks. So I haven\'t figured out the formula yet."Of course there are trainers psychologists and everything. But it all comes down to your own thinking. They can only contribute so much."Gujrathi feels India\'s D Gukesh is a "clear favourite" in the World Championship final against defending champion Ding Liren scheduled in Singapore later this year."Gukesh I mean he\'s a clear favourite. There\'s no doubt in that. Ding is really not showing his best play. My hope is that it\'s a match you know… It should not be one-sided at least from a spectator\'s point of view. One-sided match would be a real shame."']

BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-RoadLearn MoreHe urged the state govt (Maharashtra) to do a lot more for chess taking a cue from Tamil Nadu."The sport will grow only after 360-degree support" said Kunte who played four Olympiads from 1998 to 2004. "We also have a challenge (in Maharashtra) to stop some players from concentrating on academics and encourage some to take up academics by leaving chess."On why associations or the system cannot produce chess players in India like private coaching he said: "The problem for institutionalized coaching is raising funds and not getting the same level of players. You need 6-8 players above Elo 2400 (to make GM training feasible). Many state associations don\'t have those many top-ranked players."Yes the AICF can do it. But the top-level players will never be a part of it. They cannot prepare together because they are competitors. They won\'t share their preparation on round-the-year-basis."About the women\'s Olympiad campaign Kunte said the team was confident but it was also a question of having energy at the end. "The team lost out on experience after Humpy\'s withdrawal due to personal reasons. D Harika decided to play at the last minute."Like in 2022 the women\'s team won the first seven rounds and then suffered blips (defeat to Poland in R8 and draw with USA in R9)."Resting Harika after the Poland defeat was tricky. When good positions are not converted players start to lose confidence. I had to drop either Vaishali or Harika for the USA clash. Since Harika is more experienced I had to gamble on her coming good or recovering better after the rest. She needed to make her thoughts (after the rest) aligned with the team goals. But not resting Vaishali meant she had to play three successive rounds with black pieces."Kunte added that the next round against China (which India won) became a tough situation again."Vaishali lost her second game in a row (vs USA) and she was destroyed. On the other hand Divya was winning clean but Vantika\'s games were not clean."I was nervous for the penultimate round - whether to drop Vaishali or not. Apart from losing the two preceding games she was also exhausted. Though this was not said in as many words one player did not want to play (Vaishali) and one player was very eager to play (Tania) in R10. We could see that from their faces and body language. I had to make a decision where both could be unhappy (laughs). But luckily that decision to play Vaishali proved correct."Kunte who has planned his post playing career remarkably well with forays in coaching administration and politics talked candidly about court cases and sports code."That will be a part of the system. Any association will face internal issues compliance issues different and bizarre court orders on various subjects" he said."I work with many sports being a manager at Indian Oil. And every sport is suffering because of non-clarity due to lack of understanding of the Sports Code and a number of court orders. I don\'t think govt can be happy with the situation if they want to host the 2036 Summer Olympics. Somebody has to intervene and break this stalemate. Sports Code made in 2010 may not be relevant in 2024."']

This historic win underscores India's rising stature in global chess competitions.", 'Viswanathan Anand. (Photo by Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images)NEW DELHI: "If you had to roll the dice these are pretty good teams to roll them with." Viswanathan Anand was highly confident that India will emerge from the Chess Olympiad this time "smelling" gold.And to the great satisfaction of the Grandmaster who has been instrumental in molding some of the most talented young players in Indian chess today the nation won gold in both the men\'s and women\'s divisions at the 45th Olympiad in Budapest Hungary.D Gukesh R Praggnanandhaa Arjun Erigaisi Vidit Gujrathi and P Harikrishna who were challenging for the World Championship dominated the tournament to win the gold in the open segment finishing ahead of the top-seeded teams from the USA and Uzbekistan.Next to complete an Indian sweep Harika Dronavalli R Vaishali Divya Deshmukh Vantika Agrawal and Tania Sachdev won the top honors in the women\'s event ahead of Kazakhstan and the USA.Anand the game\'s first superstar was a suitable fit for such a historic occasion for the nation as per PTI.In the last Olympiad which took place in Chennai the home state of both teams bronze medals had been won. Although Anand was aware that they "were smelling the gold" at the moment he let it slide in the last moments.The 54-year-old five-time world champion however expressed confidence in both teams\' abilities to compete in Budapest in an interview with PTI prior to the Olympiad and he considered it icing on the cake that he was present to see history being made by them in the Hungarian city."...you know if I had to roll the dice these are good teams to roll them with" he had said.The bespectacled chess maestro established the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA) in Chennai four years ago where Gukesh Praggnanandhaa Erigaisi and Vaishali received their training.18-year-old Gukesh and 19-year-old Praggnanandhaa have frequently said that "Vishy sir" is the reason they are where they are.Therefore it should come as no surprise that he was referred to as the "father of Indian chess boom" by the International Chess Federation (FIDE). This came after Gukesh became the youngest contender for the world title in April after winning the Candidates to which the legendary Garry Kasparov paid homage to his brilliance by declaring that the "children of Vishy Anand are on the loose!"Anand acknowledges that his notion of a chess academy which was influenced by institutions he had seen in the Soviet Union more than three decades ago did have some influence but he prefers to share the credit with the players\' parents and early instructors."The aim was very simply to help. Indians were consistently getting to the top 200 but not quite in breaking into the top 100 in the same way. So the idea was you know can we support the most talented youngsters and see if we can just help them get past that stretch? I think we have been successful now" he had said before the Olympiad."I mean obviously there are lots and lots of people involved. Not only you know WACA but also their parents their own coaches we try to integrate and make sure that we can fit in nicely. But I think you know we definitely played our part."During the Olympiad Anand acknowledged to FIDE that he was taken aback by how quickly individuals such as Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa had risen to prominence."I took all the youngsters who had become Grandmaster before the age of 14. To be honest the idea was to support them from being top juniors to becoming world beaters" he said."My initial group was Praggnanandhaa Gukesh Arjun joined a bit later. In the girls Vaishali was there. Did I expect it to go this fast? Not really. Did I suspect this could happen? Yes. But somehow this is unbelievable" he added."This is not a coincidence but at the same time exceeds my expectations."Given the difficulties WACA had before taking off the kind semi-retired player-who still wins events for fun-is happy with his accomplishments as a mentor. The most recent being the Leon Masters in Spain a few months ago.When the academy was established in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic was at its worst.Anand is happy to have been there since he knew he had a group of really unique kids entrusting him with their future."It feels like a magical time for India. As I said with such players you know that you\'ll have a certain amount of results but they consistently exceeded (expectations). It\'s very nice to have it all at the same time" he said grinning widely.']

This remarkable feat accomplished on Sunday marks a watershed moment in the country's chess history and solidifies India's position as a global powerhouse in the sport.The Indian open team led by the prodigious talents of Gukesh D Praggnanandhaa R and Arjun Erigaisi dominated the tournament with an impressive 21 out of 22 match points.TOP PICKS FOR YOUWatch: Team India celebrates historic Chess Olympiad double gold in style fans draw parallels with Rohit Sharma's 'walk' at T20 World Cup'We were in celebration mode since yesterday': D Gukesh after India win Chess Olympiad goldTheir final round victory against Slovenia with a convincing 3.5-0.5 score was a testament to their unwavering focus and competitive spirit.The women's team featuring seasoned players like Harika Dronavalli alongside rising stars such as Divya Deshmukh secured their gold with a crucial win against Azerbaijan in the final round amassing 19 match points.This double triumph is not merely a statistical achievement but a culmination of years of strategic investment in chess development in India. The legacy of Viswanathan Anand India's first Grandmaster and former world champion is evident in the success of the current generation. Three of the open team's top players - Gukesh Praggnanandhaa and Arjun - are products of the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA) an initiative spearheaded by Anand himself to nurture young talent.  BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-RoadThe rapid rise of these young players is particularly noteworthy. Gukesh at just 18 years old remained undefeated throughout the Olympiad and even scored a victory against Fabiano Caruana a former world championship contender. Arjun Erigaisi's ascent to the world's top three players behind only Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura further underscores the depth of talent in the Indian team.This success story is even more impressive considering the challenges posed by the global pandemic in recent years. Despite the disruptions these young prodigies have not only continued their development but have surpassed expectations with some now boasting higher ratings than Anand himself.The women's team's performance was equally stellar with 18-year-old Divya Deshmukh emerging as a standout player. Her unbeaten run and crucial victory in the final match earned her an individual gold medal on board three highlighting the bright future of women's chess in India.The Olympiad itself was a monumental event featuring a record-breaking 193 teams in the Open section and 181 in the Women's competition. This level of participation underscores the global appeal of chess and the prestige associated with the Olympiad.While India's triumph was the headline story the battle for silver and bronze medals in both sections was fiercely contested. In the Open category five teams tied for second place with 17 points with the USA and Uzbekistan ultimately securing silver and bronze respectively after tiebreaks. The women's section saw Kazakhstan claim silver while Team USA edged out Spain Armenia and Georgia for bronze in another tight contest.This double gold medal performance represents a significant improvement from India's bronze medals in both sections at the 2022 Olympiad held in Mamallapuram Chennai. The progression from bronze to gold in just two years reflects the rapid development and growing confidence of Indian chess.Looking ahead the chess community in India and beyond is now eagerly anticipating the World Chess Championship later this year where Gukesh will have the opportunity to compete against China’s Ding Liren for the world title. A victory there would cap off an extraordinary year for Indian chess and potentially usher in a new era of dominance.The success of the Indian teams at the 2024 Chess Olympiad is not just a triumph of individual talent but a testament to the country's systematic approach to nurturing chess excellence. From grassroots development to high-performance training academies India has created a robust ecosystem that is now bearing fruit on the global stage. As the chess world looks on it's clear that India's ascendancy in the sport is no fleeting phenomenon but the dawn of a new chess superpower.(The writer is a Mumbai based tech entrepreneur and an avid chess enthusiast)"]

This rare act emphasizes the beauty and artistry inherent in chess showcasing how appreciation for skill can surpass personal pride and ego.", "Cerebral supremacy has a quiet undertone to it. It tells the inferior performer that he is not good enough.You can hide behind the lack of execution in other sports while consoling yourself that your understanding was not inferior. But not in chess. And the hardest part about the sport is to accept that you have lost fair and square. Hence many chess players have a somewhat valid reason for being emotional and egoistic.But behind that self-centred mind could lie the appreciator of artistry aesthetics and class.And sometimes that love trumps self-love.Peter Prohaszka (representing hosts Hungary 'B' team) proved that when he allowed India's Erigaisi Arjun to checkmate him in the third round of Chess Olympiad in Budapest on Friday. He doffed his hat to Arjun's genius and did not turn poorer for doing it.Allowing the opponent to come up with a nice finishing touch is not easy in any sport. For example a bowler would try to deny the batsman a much needed hundred (sometimes even by bowling a wide when a run is needed for a win) and a moment of personal glory by dismissing him.Chess has a provision for resignation - once you accept that you are losing or have realised the same - the game can be stopped then and there with a handshake.Unlike other sports a chess game doesn't need to complete either victory or the designated duration of the match. Moves in a beautiful endgame either with equally teasing counterplay or not are not played on the board majority of times (due the resignation) and hence not recorded. They remain plausible posterity hidden in imagination thus denying them to be a part of history and documentation.Prohaszka's magnanimous act of not resigning but allowing a checkmate on Friday against Arjun is not utterly rare in the 64-square sport but not too frequent either.Russia's Peter Svidler deliberately allowed Magnus Carlsen a checkmate with a pawn push in the Grenke Classic of 2019 in Baden-Baden Germany. He also came up with a wry smile afterwards.Stalemate in which both players get half point each as the king is trapped without squares but without check and other pieces cannot move is a poor cousin of the beautiful checkmate.Sometimes a point given - by getting checkmated in case of chess - can underscore a larger point. That of upholding the sense of beauty higher and protecting the very ethos of the sport.Prohaszaka's act showed that in ample measure and made the followers of the sport richer and fall in love with the chequered life once again."]
