The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves are set to face off in the first of two preseason games in the United Arab Emirates capital showcasing the growing influence of the league in the region.However while the on-court action takes centre stage the real game-changer is happening off the court. Qatar\'s sovereign wealth fund has made headlines with its purchase of a minority stake in the Washington Wizards marking a significant move less than a year after the NBA\'s Board of Governors opened the door to institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds.Notably NBA superstar LeBron James recently visited Saudi Arabia sparking further interest in the region. The visit followed a social media comment by James where he humorously mentioned he would consider the astronomical offers being made to attract football stars to Saudi Arabia.The NBA\'s ties with the Arabian Gulf have been growing stronger. Last year the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks played preseason games in Abu Dhabi after the league signed a multiyear partnership with the emirate\'s department of culture and tourism. It marked the first time the NBA hosted games in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf also known as the Persian Gulf.Mark Tatum NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating officer emphasized the league\'s commitment to expanding its presence in the region: "We felt that bringing the live NBA experience to fans in Abu Dhabi was the next step in our ongoing efforts to grow the game in the region."In November 2022 the NBA\'s board of governors made a significant decision allowing passive non-controlling minority investments in NBA teams by institutional investors including university endowments foreign and domestic pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. These investments are subject to league review and NBA Board approval.Qatar Investment Authority\'s acquisition of a roughly 5% stake in the parent company of the Washington Wizards Washington Capitals and Washington Mystics has already received NBA approval setting a precedent for similar agreements in the future.Tatum highlighted the increasing value of NBA teams and the global appeal of the league anticipating continued interest from institutional investors worldwide. However he clarified that while the NBA seeks to engage international fans through games played abroad the league does not necessarily endorse or agree with every law or viewpoint in host countries. He emphasized their commitment to adhering to U.S. government guidance and staying true to the NBA\'s mission and values.While Saudi Arabia with its sovereign wealth fund has made significant investments in professional golf and football it has not initiated talks with the NBA about investing in teams. Additionally the NBA has not discussed holding preseason games in Saudi Arabia.As part of the NBA\'s presence in Abu Dhabi the league plans to conduct youth clinics and host fan events featuring players from the Mavericks and Timberwolves as well as NBA legends such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The preseason games will be held at Etihad Arena on Yas Island where the NBA opened an NBA Store last year.Following the Abu Dhabi games the Dallas Mavericks will travel to Spain for a preseason matchup against Real Madrid next Tuesday continuing their global outreach efforts.(With AP inputs)']

Such players will be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul which will not count as a personal foul or result in ejection.Under these rules the opposing team will receive one free throw and gain possession of the ball.Officials will not be required to halt live play to assess a flopping violation; instead they can wait for the next "neutral opportunity" to pause the game and apply the penalty.The league has stated that these proposed flopping penalty rules will be in effect on a provisional basis throughout the summer league games taking place this year. The summer league which commenced on Monday and spans the next two weeks in Sacramento Salt Lake City and Las Vegas will serve as a testing ground for the new regulations.Since 2012 the NBA has primarily relied on public warnings and occasional fines to address flopping but there have been no specific in-game penalties for such actions. Currently if the league determines that a player has flopped a warning is issued followed by escalating fines for subsequent violations.(AI image)When initially determining fines for flopping in 2012 the NBA defined a flop as "an attempt to either fool referees into calling undeserved fouls or fool fans into thinking the referees missed a foul call by exaggerating the effect of contact with an opposing player."For the penalty to be enforced in the upcoming 2023-24 season or future seasons it must receive approval from the NBA Board of Governors.(With agency inputs)']
