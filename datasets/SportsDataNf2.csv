Richardson who has had six games this season with a 50% loss rate shows a mixed record of promise and struggle including high turnovers and frequent sacks that stifle scoring drives.Richardsons progression has been slow partly due to a lingering shoulder injury. However Orlovsky believes Steichens decision prioritizes team success over development. I do think that its hard for him to continue to develop the in-game skills needed to play at a higher level if hes not playing and I think that the Shane is realizing I got a good enough team like we can go win ball games and right now he believes that Joe is probably better suited to go get that done Orlovsky shared on The Rich Eisen Show.

To make matters worse Teppers tendency to replace head coaches the moment things go south creates instability. Just imagine how tough its been for a young quarterbacks development working under three different head coaches in one season.The Panthers benched their young QB in favor of Andy Dalton sparking a brief glimmer of hope. With Dalton sidelined for a few games the young QB now has a shot at reclaiming his starting spot. But this constant shakeup could be too much for him. Without a strong mentor to guide him its no wonder hes struggling.The Panthers recent loss brings them to a 1-7 record officially marking them as the NFLs bottom team with no clear signs of improvement on the horizon.Also Read: RIP: Baker Mayfield honors Cleveland legacy while mourning loss of Browns icon'],,

He did return to practice today but experts like Mike Florio and Rodney Harrison suggest he should take time to rest before returning to the field. Fans are eager to see him play against the Bears this Sunday but that hope is tempered by the nature of his injury.A rib injury is particularly concerning for a quarterback given the demands of throwing. Daniels is also known for his dual-threat capabilities which increases his risk of further injury. In just seven games he has already notched four rushing touchdowns alongside six touchdown passes and he boasts an impressive 372 rushing yards. This is especially noteworthy considering he averages over 200 passing yards per game even with limited play against the Panthers. Keeping him healthy is crucial for the Commanders as they look to capitalize on their strong start.With Daniels sidelined veteran quarterback Marcus Mariota has had the chance to step in. The 30-year-old Hawaii native has only played five games in the last two years but he rose to the occasion last Sunday throwing for 205 yards and two touchdown passes leading the team to a resounding victory.

Meanwhile the Washington Commanders find themselves in a similar position but lets focus on the Bears. Both teams are eager to secure a victory in this crucial matchup.Unfortunately for the Bears theyre competing in a tough NFC North where they remain the only team yet to reach five wins. The Vikings Lions and Packers are all thriving this season making every game a vital opportunity for the Bears to climb the standings. On the other hand the Commanders are leading the NFC East but with the Eagles closely trailing at 4-2 theyll be fighting to maintain their edge.In a must-win scenario having your star player on the field is crucial. Coach Dan Quinn recently commented on Jayden Daniels practice session stating We will assess how he responds to the work that we did over the next 48 hours. But we really pushed it today. While the idea of playing Daniels is enticing the risk of aggravating his rib injury is a serious concern. A setback could extend his recovery when a short break now might suffice. (via: EssentiallySports)Take note of the cautionary tale involving the Buccaneers Mike Evans who returned from a hamstring injury too soon and ended up in excruciating pain on the field last Monday. Now hes sidelined for another four weeks. What Jayden Daniels needs is rest and a management team willing to prioritize his recovery.

After a rough start things took an even darker turn when quarterback Andy Dalton and his family were injured in a car accident leaving him with a sprained thumb. Now the weight of these struggles falls heavily on head coach Dave Canales as the team looks to rookie Bryce Young to start against the Denver Broncos.

Laughing over the Broncos being favored by double digits Lombardi pointed out the Panthers woes questioning if theyre equipped to compete at all.

I mean theyre hurt everywhere and they are not a good team. (via: EssentiallySports)The most intriguing part of this story however is what could have been. Panthers owner David Tepper once had a chance to hire coaching legend Sean Payton a move that might have changed Carolinas trajectory. Instead Tepper took a risk on Canales a newcomer to head coaching and promoted Assistant GM Dan Morgan drawing criticism from Lombardi who commented I mean you talk about a design problem this happens right here in Carolina. For me Dave Canales is not ready to be a head coach. I certainly dont think Dan Morgans ready to be a general manager.For a fan base tired of setbacks Payton could have been the breath of fresh air they needed. Now the Panthers and their fans are left to wonder how different things might look with a proven leader at the helm.Was Sean Payton an option for David Tepper?A hundred bucks says yes. Panthers owner David Tepper was reportedly willing to offer just about anything to bring in Super Bowl-winning coach Sean Payton. Paytons impressive 15-year stint with the New Orleans Saints boasts a strong offensive record and six NFC South championships. So why didnt the Panthers land him? First check out Michael Lombardis take: If I were David Tepper and I knew all these people that I put in place and Im still 10 points than the Denver Broncos who hired Sean Payton and you dont want to hire. You could have hired Sean Payton. But you dont want to give up control to hire Sean Payton. Heres Sean Payton rebuilding the Broncos but you didnt want him to rebuild the Panthers Lombardi ranted adding that Payton may make Tepper eat it in the upcoming game.Now heres the catchor rather was the catch. When Payton retired from the Saints in January 2022 he wasnt fired; the Saints still held his rights. To hire him Tepper would need to negotiate with New Orleans perhaps a factor in Teppers decision.Payton took an analyst role with FOX post-retirement but soon felt the pull back to coaching. Now hes leading the Broncos with a five-year $90 million contract. Meanwhile Teppers Panthers struggling since he acquired the team in 2018 have cycled through head coaches and now face another tough season.One question remains: why did Carolina trade away DJ Moore along with two 2023 picks a 2024 first-rounder and a 2025 second-round pick to draft Bryce Young only to bench him for Andy Dalton?

Though Kelce wasnt present at Swifts Miami concert her influence managed to surface in unexpected places. Notably Swift altered the lyrics of her song Karma to give a shoutout to the Kansas City Chiefs star tight end. However what caught attention recently is that her name inspired more than just song lyrics  it influenced play-calling on the football field.Also Read: ""Whos soft and whos not soft"": Bill Belichick sharpens his criticism of Patriots coaching staff amid disappointing 1-6 season startWhat is Taylor Swift play call?In an unusual turn of events Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury revealed how Taylor Swift became a part of an actual NFL play. In Week 7 during the Commanders dominant 40-7 win against the Carolina Panthers a specific play led to rookie tight end Ben Sinnotts three-yard touchdown catch and Kingsbury made an interesting revelation. He shared His first catch was a touchdown and the play was called Taylor Swift. We probably carried it three weeks and just finally got to calling it.Though there is no concrete proof that Taylor Swift directly inspired the play the association is amusing and undeniable. After Sinnott caught the touchdown pass from Marcus Mariota he found himself in a blank space cleverly referencing Swifts famous song. Sinnotts swift move included faking out the Panthers edge defender before darting into the corner creating enough separation to score the easy touchdown.This quirky connection between Swift and NFL play-calling isnt entirely unheard of. Throughout the leagues history various famous personalities have been referenced during play calls adding a layer of fun and creativity to the game. For instance last season Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow included playful references to Tom Brady Steven Spielberg and other celebrities in his calls. Similarly Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was overheard calling plays named after LeBron James in a matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars.As Taylor Swifts influence grows it seems her involvement with the NFL has taken on new forms from song lyrics to touchdown calls. This unlikely crossover between the NFL and the music world brings a fun twist to both entertainment realms proving once again that Taylor Swift is a force to be reckoned with on and off the stage.Also Read: ""We dont have time"": Davante Adams opens up about his emotional speech to Jets after crushing loss to Steelers']",,

It was acknowledged by Adams that there was a visible lack of effort during the game.

Adding salt to their wounds they squandered a game that should have been winnable turning it into a blowout due to preventable mistakes. To make matters worse Adams sensed that his new teammates gave up after the Steelers took control of the game. The mentality he witnessed was far from that of a winner and Adams didnt leave his previous struggles in Las Vegas just to join another losing effort. To come out flat like that and essentially give away a game thats unacceptable Adams emphasized stressing that hes trying to inject a winning swagger and culture into the Jets.Despite his intentions Adams had a rough debut managing only three catches for 30 yards. However he did make a standout defensive effort chasing down Beanie Bishop Jr. after an interception to prevent a pick-six. While it didnt change the outcome it was a testament to Adams winning mindset. Now back with Rodgers Adams knows theres no time to waste. He felt obligated to speak up even though hed only been with the Jets for a short time. Regardless if I just got here Im a leader of this football team Adams said.

With the likes of Lamar Jackson Josh Allen Jared Goff CJ Stroud and Jordan Love also in the mix it raises eyebrows as to why Mahomes stands out. However after witnessing the recent performances of Goff and Jackson its clear that the MVP race requires a reevaluation. Join Florio as he dives into the necessary adjustments.Will Lamar Jackson be out of MVP conversation this season?Mike Florio and Michael Holley recently discussed the MVP race noting that top-seed quarterbacks usually dominate the conversation. Holley emphasized that while the Chiefs quarterback may win MVP due to team success Patrick Mahomes individual performance marked by eight interceptions is less impressive compared to other top contenders.Florio believes Jared Goff could be a significant NFC candidate especially with the Lions strong performance. However the conversation took a twist with Derrick Henrys name emerging as a contender. Florio stated that for Henry to secure MVP he needs to break the single-season rushing record. Currently he leads the league with 874 yards and eight touchdowns.Meanwhile Lamar Jackson shines with 1810 passing yards and 15 touchdowns bolstering his MVP case after a stellar game against the Buccaneers. As the season unfolds the MVP race remains wide open.Jared Goff and Lions make waves in NFCThe Detroit Lions are currently the top team in the NFC boasting a 5-1 record. The only team that comes close is the Minnesota Vikings whom the Lions recently defeated snapping their perfect streak in a thrilling matchup. The game had its tense moments especially when the Lions fumbled allowing the Vikings to make a play. However quarterback Jared Goff quickly rallied the team leading them to a 31-29 victory with a crucial field goal.Goff showcased his skills by completing 22 of 25 passes for over 280 yards and two touchdowns. Earlier this season he set an NFL record by going 18 for 18 in a win against the Seattle Seahawks. His impressive performances have even drawn praise from Tom Brady who in the latest episode of his Lets Go! podcast on October 22 highlighted Goffs accuracy and decision-making.Hes [Goff] accurate stands in the pocket and makes the throws. He knows he will not run around like Patrick or Lamar or Josh Allen but hes going to read the coverages out hes going to make the decisions he is very accurate throwing that ball down the field he has got receivers who are getting open. Its just a good formula for winning. Brady noted. (via: EssentiallySports)Currently the only quarterback who could rival Goffs potential is Lamar Jackson. While Patrick Mahomes could also be in the mix his success depends heavily on the talent surrounding him. As Jackson seeks to defend his MVP title from last year Goff is making a strong case for this years recognition.Also Read: Is Marvin Harrison Jr. playing against Chargers?

In a discussion on The Herd with Colin Cowherd senior NFL reporter Albert Breer addressed the high-pressure environment surrounding the head coach.On one hand Cowherd noted that Nick Sirianni got into trouble after yelling at fans. On the other hand Breer pointed out that the Eagles made significant changes by replacing both of Siriannis coordinators which could serve as a warning sign from owner Jeff Lurie to the coach.

My energy should be all in on coaching motivating and celebrating with our guys. I have to have better wisdom and discernment of when to use that energy and that wasnt the time.Sirianni is well aware of the passionate Eagles fanbase which he affectionately referred to as the best in the world consistently showing up to support the team no matter where they play. In a city like Philadelphia where the expectations are sky-high and the media scrutiny is relentless he understands that every move is closely watched.Despite his commitment Sirianni has been known to display emotional outbursts during high-pressure moments. As he moves forward the coach will need to find ways to manage his reactions staying focused not only on the field but off it as well.Also Read: Following wedding hints Jordan Loves fiance Ronika Stone unveils latest Obsession']",,

His injury occurred during the Dolphins Week 2 loss against the Buffalo Bills on September 12. Before stepping onto the field for the game Tagovailoa must navigate the NFLs concussion protocol. This process requires him to engage in ""non-contact football activity"" which is the final hurdle before receiving clearance to play according to ESPNs Marcel Louis-Jacques. Remarkably Tagovailoa mentioned earlier this week that he had not experienced any concussion symptoms since September 13 the day following the loss to the Bills.Showing up his commitment he revealed that he had been preparing as if he were getting ready for each game diligently practicing his footwork and studying game plans prior to returning to practice.
