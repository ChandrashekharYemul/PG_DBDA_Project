Now focusing on the next Nationals Chaudhary aims to regain his past form and make a comeback.', "Saurabh Chaudhary (Photo Source: X)NEW DELHI: India is hosting some of the best shooters from the world at the World Cup Finals here at the Karni Singh ranges and it is ironical that Saurabh Chaudhary insists he wants to have a conversation away from the venue at a cafe.One of the finest pistol shooters India has seen Chaudhary is not part of the Indian team anymore. He wants to shun attention these days when he isn’t shooting or otherwise.From being world No. 1 as an 18-year-old boy to someone who has been away from limelight for more than two years Saurabh seems to have grown up fast. He is still not a small-talk person though. So where has he been?“I have been here... shooting all the time but not in the Indian team” he says in a typical Saurabh-like manner. “There is nothing to share hence I avoid interviews” he says.

Help them afford medical careGive Hope IndiaLearn MoreHe doesn’t have answers to his prolonged absence. “I did not go underground after the Tokyo Games. I took the result in my stride. I didn’t win a medal but I made it to the final of one event. I shot well in a few events after Tokyo but don’t know what happened after that. I was shooting fine earlier I don’t know what happened suddenly. Everything is the same except I am not scoring what I used to” he says.“I don’t think the scores have gone up. They are the same that I used to hit but I feel there are many more shooters now who can hit those scores. When I was in the team there were only a few who could hit above 580. Now there are many.“I have been hitting somewhere around 577-580” he says adding he hasn’t been able to identify the reason for his below-par scores.“No I don’t overthink... haven’t been bothered by what happened in Tokyo. It is past for me.”But former Commonwealth Games champion shooter-turned-coach Samaresh Jung says: “He has been overthinking. Overanalyzing too.”Jung who trains Saurabh adds: “He may not admit but he gets worried about the scores. He was a shooter who never bothered about the results. I have seen him shoot 23 straight 10s without even thinking about the scores. Now he has started to think before his shots.”“I think I have forgotten the feeling of a good shot” Saurabh says. “Possibly because we tend to analyze our bad shots more... we don’t take time to remember the feeling before and after a good shot” Jung adds.Saurabh is not thinking about the future.“I am not thinking about the 2028 LA Games. But I never thought about the Tokyo Games either. I know that I will be part of the Games if I shoot well. I am trying to reach where I had left” he says.He is targetting next month’s Nationals.“It is a fresh start for everybody let’s see.”After an hour-long chat one still can’t figure out what happened to the shooter who had won two World Championships 12 World Cup (8 gold) one Asian Games gold and many more international medals.Can he hit the comeback trail?

Unlike the Ukraine shooters who withdrew from tournaments where Russian players participated Ray doesn\'t mind participating in the tournament with Israeli shooters. There are none in the World Cup Finals here."For me it\'s not about the athletes because I believe that we are both facing the same feelings. Maybe deep inside we\'re looking for peace for sure. Unfortunately we have bigger constraints like the government forbids us to take part in any competition if there is any presence of such an athlete (from Israel). And I think it\'s the same for Ukraine or Russia or any other country which is facing war. I believe it is our right to participate regardless of politics. We are athletes we are here to represent our country. So we have to respect each other no matter what. This is what the Olympics system - peace and respect for others and keeping politics away - teaches us."She added: "I think only athletes get the opportunity to spread peace because they can go out and meet people.

He said this at a function hosted by Gagan Narang\'s Gun For Glory academy in Balewadi. However Patil was unavailable when TOI tried to contact him for his response to Kusale\'s comment.While there\'s no sign of the \'special package\' the shooter who is a Railways employee said he was told to apply for a regular state govt job.

BY TABOOLASPONSORED LINKSYOU MAY LIKEAmazon CFD: Your Route to a Second IncomeCPX-RoadLearn MoreThanking the audience for a warm welcome Manu said "For me the target will be the journey to gold in the Olympic games so the next thing will be LA for me. However I am on a short break for now. It\'s been eight and a half years that I took a break from my sport. So right now is the time when I\'m like 3 months 4 months (break) I will take and then start back with my training again for LA 2028.And all the competitions in between I am like it\'s just a milestone and the further goal will beLA 2028 for me. And right now also I am enjoying everything I mean I am getting to dress up and all (giggles) so it\'s fun and games."Manu was then asked to reflect on one of her recent quotes where she had said that one can become an engineer or a doctor whichever respective field you want to excel in and so is with sport that has so much to offer in today\'s times but does any other profession has the pain the offer the way sport does because if things don\'t work like what happened in Tokyo it can be pretty painful.Manu said "It can be (painful) but I believe that when you have really invested in something when something is really close to your heart for example for me it\'s my sport I am really connected to it emotionally physically mentally so it will cause pain when sometimes you are not able to deliver to the level that you have been expecting. So for some of the people it will be sport for some it will be education for some it will be business. So whenever you have really invested in something and you are not really able to deliver to your levels that will cause a lot of pain. And sports I believe gave me an opportunity to travel the world which I really really enjoyed so I would really be like \'go into sports but also you have to balance your studies and everything\'. Everything is really important you can\'t be like just sports or just activities or just studies it should be a balance in life."(TOI Photo)On being asked how lonely a sport like shooting can get Manu said "We (shooters) find our interests in it for me my sport gives me kick. For example if I am shooting in some event and I do not win so for the next event for me it will be like \'I have to win I have to win in the next competition\'. The mistakes I made I should learn from them and not repeat in the next one. So we set short-term goals for the very next competition or the next year\'s competitions. In beginning shooting can be really really boring for some people but once you start to get a hold of it I am sure it\'s really interesting for a hobby also. It can be really interesting to keep your mind off things. So I really enjoy it and I would ask you all whenever you come to the ranges if you get time please try shooting it\'s a very good stress reliever as well."On being asked if her hobbies that she has been cultivating apart from shooting sketching horse riding playing the violin reading are really hobbies or coping mechanisms to cope with shooting Manu said "For me they are just hobbies because I really enjoy doing different things I mean we all should find time for ourselves to be able to do things that we really like. Some people like to try different sports for example on Sundays they go for a run for a football match or something some people go for movies and all. You should definitely find time for yourself definitely devote atleast five hours or so every week for yourself and it\'ll make you feel really good. For me it\'s trying different sports different activities it\'s really fun and easy. You should enjoy what you do and if you find out time for yourself even like 5-6 hours every week it\'ll really elevate your mood and it\'ll really be able to help you focus better in what you\'re doing in your life."Manu was then asked what was more difficult finding motivation after Tokyo or staying motivated now after this kind of a high that she sees.Manu replies "I believe both of those situations like the one that I had after Tokyo it took a toll on me I was really really heartbroken I was like next time I have to win and I must win but during the process as soon as Tokyo ended I was really motivated for the next Olympic games but 2022 and 2023 showed me a really tough time. So coping up at that time was really difficult for me but I was like that just put in your honest hard work and just let it be. I would like to share this with you all that before Paris Olympics I was not able to win any major medal in any event. I was winning team medals but not individual medals so I was really not confident before entering Paris 2024 but my coach and my family were like \'you must deliver what you\'ve learnt you must try to do your best in this event and just let it be. You will win a medal.\' He (the coach) was really confident in me but I was not but when you are really focused in your process I am sure you will get the results as well."On being asked to talk about her going back to academics as athletes across sports struggle with their careers post retirement and by going back to academics she is really setting a benchmark for younger kids Manu said "I never left studies. I come from a family of engineers professors teachers and all so it\'s like I have this kind of pressure when I am in studies in schools or colleges. So there is this little pressure that if you fail it\'s not going to look good on your profile. I don\'t want to be tagged like \'she failed this class you\'re off the college\'. So I would not like do that and my tutors really help me with that and I believe that you should be able to balance everything in your life. One thing cannot take you as far as you would want to go so for me it\'s like when I get free time out of sport I really enjoy studying as well and my tutors really help me with that."Manu was then asked to talk about her life as a teenager during which youngsters tend to hang around with friends and she was practicing shooting at the range.Manu replies "I am sure many people like to enjoy their teenage years hanging out with friends or going for a movie but for me it was never really the case. I was actually not able to make friends because I was not really around in school times or college times so I was mostly out for shooting competitions for the country and I think at that time when I was 16-17-18 years old the major thing that really inspired me and motivated me and that kept me going was that if I lose one competition I would be really pissed off I would be like \'how could you lose how are you not able to win this competition\' so that would really trigger me it would actually trigger me a lot and then if I win a competition I would be like \'you have to repeat it you have to do it again.\' So that was my motivation that really kept me going when I was 16-17-18-19 but right now I am more patient with things like \'OK you will win when you will just keep going with the flow and keep putting your hard work.\' I also enjoy watching movies and all with my family and friends I take out time as I mentioned earlier I take out time for my hobbies I take out time to spend with my family and as a human being that is the foremost priority we should have spending time with your family and giving yourself time as well that\'ll really really help you mentally physically and to go in a longer run in your careers."Manu was then asked if she was a product of the system because champions have gone on to become what they\'ve become apropos the system like in some ways there are athletes who have benefitted from the system and then there are athletes who have gone on to succeed regardless of what the system has provided what does she look at herself as.Manu answers "We all come across several challenging moments in our lives and in our careers for me also sometimes it was really challenging for me to be able to alongwith the system sometimes the system really helped me to actually achieve something in life like win some competition or qualify for some events or competitions. So it was both actually the system helped me also and when it was challenging for me. For example before the Paris Olympics we had 4-5 sets of trials and I was shooting in three events it was really hectic for me. It was challenging but it really made me strong and I came out stronger and actually it really helped me in Paris as well. So I don\'t think we can always have everything how we want them to be sometimes life will throw really hard times at you sometimes it\'ll be really difficult for you all it was for me as well but that time will really make you stronger and I can\'t say I am a product of something or not but everything that has happened in my life really made me who I am today and I am really grateful that it had happened."On being asked about the small struggles that a shooter faces like importing a gun and whether things have improved Manu said "Initially I did face this challenge that I was not really able to get a license to import a pistol but sooner the things were addressed and I also got help from the government and from the media people specially the media was the body that really helped me with getting a license for the first time when I had to import the pistol so everything can be useful I never imagined I will have such good relations with media people in the longer term and definitely I believe that challenges will help you get stronger in life. There\'s a saying that God will throw challenges at you thinking that you are capable of overcoming that and becoming even stronger. So just face the challenges whatever there are in your lives and I am sure some people have it even tougher challenges in lives but they\'ll make us stronger."(TOI Photo)Manu was then asked how emotionally fragile shooters\' life can be and how she stays away from anything that can negatively impact her as it\'s such a mental thing.Manu replies "Yes it gets boring at times for me as well even now. My sport has taught me so much of patience earlier I was a really impulsive person. I would really react to things quickly specially when I was into boxing and karate I was so impulsive in nature I was like if it\'s getting out of my hands I would react immediately. Bit this sport has taught me lot of patience and I would say that you should actually stick by what you really like in life. Shooting I really love I really enjoy playing my sport so I think I am gonna stick by for a really long time and will try for as long as it\'s possible for me for as long as I love my sport and we should all try to give our best in our fields. And India has so much of potential 1.5 billion people now and we all have so much of talent so much of potential in the coming years I think we can dominate in many many different segments of life segments of career."Before ending the session Manu added "Paralympics have just begun and Indians are also doing well let\'s all support our Paralympians let\'s cheer for them root for them we hope they bring as many medals as possible for our country and shine brighter."']

Because my medal (gold) came on September 30 and that was a significant achievement."Contrary to common opinion Sarabjot and Manu Bhaker did not train together much in the lead-up to the Olympic podium finish despite the fact that they together won medals for the nation as a mixed team."My training was due at 9 hers was due at 12 individually. Mixed session lasted for 30 minutes before which she trained separately and I separately. Our conversation was usually brief and limited to \'Apna 100 per cent dena hai (we have to give our 100 per cent)\'. Apart from that we enjoyed some banter. Sometimes I would make fun of her sometimes she would of me" revealed the Olympic bronze medal winner.The accomplished Gen Z athlete also acknowledged that he faced his fair share of obstacles along the way. The Dheen kid found that meditation particularly the unusual yogic practice of Trataka helped him focus."The main technique is to look at the candle flame with eyes open for three minutes and then imagine for two minutes. I used to keep it directly in front of my eyes. Complete darkness in the room complete peace silence. My eyes would water; it was not easy. The most important thing is visualisation in shooting" said Sarabjot revealing that he started practising Trataka to inch back to recovery from injuries a year ago.With nostalgia for his difficult time he remembered the times he would get on a motorcycle and ride to Ambala for training. This interview will come as a surprise to the young Olympian\'s family."Woh struggle hi badaa pyara tha (That struggle itself was sweet)" he added. In his concluding thoughts the Olympic medallist stated that his hunt is not over. He has set his target: " In LA 2028 iska colour change karna hai ( In LA 2028 I want to change its colour)" said Sarabjot gesturing toward his glittering bronze medal before signing off.']

However we have given them very flexible requirements because they\'ve had a series of Olympic trials of late" said NRAI senior vice-president Kalikesh Singh Deo."We\'ve allowed them to choose the events they want to participate in and the manner in which they want to participate.

The reason we are keen for them to go is that the last international competition we had was on March 8 in Baku (World Cup) and the one after this is going to be the Olympics" said Singh Deo."There is no international competition of this nature and stature which is available in this six months from Baku to the Olympics.

This has been a particularly sensitive topic for several Olympic-bound shooters including pistol expert Manu Bhaker who trains with her coach Jaspal Rana.
