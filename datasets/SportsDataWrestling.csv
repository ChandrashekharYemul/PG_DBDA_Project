If I do not cut the weight properly then how will I play?

If the sports minister has the knowledge (about the issues) I want to discuss that also" she said.Refusing to share her exact concerns Mary Kom said she would rather discuss them in the meeting with Mandaviya and BFI brass."The federation has provided all the coaches. But I have a few doubts as well. But what is the point in saying them now the Olympics are done. Now there is no point in saying all that but I want to discuss it with them in the meeting" said the former Rajya Sabha MP."(The) sports minister is doing whatever he can do from his side infrastructure facilities or whatever (other) needs are there. But how did the federation handle the training? Was it done systematically or not?

He expressed hope that this decision would bring relief to the players allowing them to focus on their training. The WFI has pledged to provide the best training facilities abroad for the athletes in consultation with their coaches.Yogeshwar Dutt a former Olympic medalist wrestler supported the decision noting that it has been a common practice in the past to send Olympic quota winners to represent the country in the games. He acknowledged the confusion among players caused by the ad hoc committee\'s earlier statements about conducting trials. Dutt emphasized the importance of clarity for the athletes and expressed hope for at least two medals in wrestling at the Paris Olympics highlighting the energy and morale of the new generation of wrestlers.India concluded their campaign at the World Olympic Wrestling Qualifiers in early May securing two more Olympic quotas through Aman Sehrawat and Nisha Dahiya in men\'s and women\'s wrestling respectively. This brought the total number of quotas won by Indian wrestlers to six. Antim Panghal (53kg) Vinesh Phogat (50kg) Anshu Malik (57kg) and Reetika Hooda (76kg) had previously secured quotas during the 2023 World Wrestling Championships and the Asian Qualifiers.However India were unable to secure a quota in Greco-Roman wrestling with Sunil Kumar an Asian Games bronze medalist being eliminated in the repechage round of the men\'s 87kg category. Notable wrestlers such as Ravi Kumar Dahiya a silver medalist in the 57kg category at the Tokyo Olympics and Deepak Punia who finished fifth in the 2020 Olympics also failed to make it to the Indian team for the qualifiers.(Inputs from ANI)']

Please save him from a deadly disorderGive Hope IndiaLearn More"The WFI has called a selection committee meeting in Delhi on May 21 to decide on the selection criteria. The two chief coaches in both styles (men\'s freestyle and women) will be part of the discussions" a WFI source told PTI.The decision of whether to proceed with trials or allow quota winners to compete directly at the Games will indeed be intriguing for the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) selection committee.Should the quota winners be given clearance to compete it could spell the end of the Paris Olympic aspirations for wrestlers like Ravi Dahiya (men\'s 57kg) and Sarita Mor (women\'s 57kg) as they would miss out on one final opportunity for selection.In the previous Tokyo Games the four quota winners—Bajrang Punia Deepak Punia Ravi Dahiya and Vinesh Phogat—retained their spots in their respective categories without undergoing trials near the Games.Led by the seasoned Vinesh Phogat (50kg) India boasts five women wrestlers vying for medals. Antim Panghal (53kg) Anshu Malik (57kg) Nisha Dahiya (68kg) and Reetika Hooda (76kg) are among the other women wrestlers who have secured quotas.There\'s a prevailing sentiment that holding trials so close to the Games may not be necessary especially considering the caliber and readiness of the athletes.Dronacharya awardee Lalit Kumar head coach at Chhatarasal Stadium in Delhi elaborated on why trials might not be essential in all categories."Most of our wrestlers have qualified very recently. It\'s not that they qualified a year back and their fitness and form need to be assessed. Sometimes the wrestler loses form or gets injured so you need to assess if they are India\'s best bet in their category because athletes can actually hide their injuries."So in this case five of the six wrestlers have earned quotas in less than one month\'s time. They were the best in their categories so they won the trials and competed in Bishkek and Istanbul."So their fitness and form is before everyone. Yes for someone like Antim Panghal who qualified at the World Championships last year WFI needs to know if she is carrying any injury for others it\'s not required" he said.Aman has also expressed concerns about trials saying it\'s time to focus on preparation for the Games and not getting ready for another painful process of weight-cut.Vinesh Phogat in a post on X also demanded clarity as to what exactly WFI wants to do with the trials.A section within the WFI also feels that trials are not required at this stage when the Games are just two months away.(With PTI inputs)']
